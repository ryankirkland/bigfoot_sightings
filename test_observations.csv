0,"OBSERVED: I and two of my friends were bored one night so we decided to do a little snowmachining. Though it was illegal to snowmachine in Anchorage, there were some good trails to ride on a little north of my house.  We took off at probably 11 pm, rode up the road about a quarter mile, and cut off on the trails. It had snowed about 10 inches a few days before so there was fresh snow, with no tracks.  I was leading the way for about a half hour, then we stopped and talked for a little bit.  We took off again and kept cruising on some sort of game trail that led to an opening in the woods.  I rode off into the opening with my friends following about fifty yards behind me.  I came over this little mound and saw strange tracks leading to this spot in the snow where it looked like something had pushed aside some snow and layed down.  I figured it was just a moose or something.  But I followed the tracks over the next small hill and as I came down the far side my headlight pointed right on the back of a bigfoot.  It was only about 10 to 12 feet in front of me.  It was running in the opposite direction.  I slammed on the brakes because I was scared out of my mind.  It continued to run away, jumped over a dead log covered in snow and disappeared into a group of trees and into the darkness.  I was so surprised and scared I quickly turned around and rode back toward my friends. I met them back by the first mound and said ""We need to get out of here,""  and rode back towards my house.  When I told them about it back near my house, they laughed and told me it was probably a bear or someone in the woods.  But I was 100% positive that is was not a bear or anything else. The way it was running through the deep snow made me sure that it wasn't anything human.  For a long time I was made fun of and everyone told me I was crazy so I didn't like talking about it.  "
1,"OBSERVED: To whom it may concern, I am a commercial fisherman in Alaska and have been doing so since 1970. I am an avid outdoorsman, hunter and someone who just loves to get out there. Every year after fishing, I try to take a trip up river with a friend or two to wind down and enjoy ourselves before we go home. This year while I was on this trip into Alaska's interior our main mission was to take pictures of bears and the surrounding wildlife to promote a new bear viewing and sports fishing buisness. While on our five day trip, we spotted more than fourty bears. I took hundrends of pictures of these bears and their tracks. One of which, was so big, it put chills up my spin and gave me and my companions a very uneasy sense of insecurity. What set this track apart from the others was it's enormous size and human shape. In one of the pictures that I took of this track, I placed my foot next to it on the ground, keep in mind I am wearing a size 13 boot. Whatever made this track was so heavy, heavier than the biggest bear, that it pushed the gravel so far into the earth that it made us truly speculate what we were looking at. Other pictures that we took of bear tracks were nowhere close to the indentation that this track had left. One of the most intriguing things about this track was there were no visible claw marks as with all the other bear tacks.Both of us felt extremely uneasy of our surroundings and had the feeling that we were being watched. For the rest of the day we didn't have much to talk about, and that night felt uncomfortable at camp. We never heard or smelt anything out of the ordinary. To this day I'm not too sure what we saw and I'm not making any claims other than the words I have put fourth. I would like to include the photos I spoke of, as maybe you or someone on your staff might help me shed some light on this situation. I want nothing but to put my mind at ease. Wether this is a bear track from an extrememly enormous bear or...? Please help if you have any input."
2,"OBSERVED: It was the month of July, 2009 in Fairbanks Alaska.  I was heading south on Auburn Dr toward Farmers Loop which was about 1 mile away.  It is a wooded area frequented by homes and in general would be considered a populated area.  Houses are on an average of about 100 to 200 feet apart with only the general area around and close to the homes cleared out.  Most of the area by far is wooded.  It was the section of the road where it passes by Pearl Creek Elementary school.  The school can be seen through the woods.  Some of the woods in the area are quite thick and in some places cant be seen into more than about 10 or 15 feet.  But in this area, it had apparently been cleaned out quite a bit and sightlines into the section of the sighting were very open.  The school and vegetable garden could be seen off to the right from the road I was on.  It was about 6pm and I was heading home after a day of working on a deck I was building.  The weather was clear with the sun high in the sky.  As I was driving, I happened to notice a man standing by the right side of the road about 100 yards ahead.  It was more of an unconscious recognition.  Theres nothing unusual about a man standing on the side of the road in this area.  As I got to within about 50 yards, I looked closer.  Thats no man I said to myself (I was alone in the car).  Shortly after that, 1 or 2 seconds, he bolted into the woods towards the school.  He did it like a wild animal would do if spooked.  I didnt slow down until I got to the place where I saw him go into the woods which is where I stopped.  I could see him running away from the road and when he was into the woods about 30 yards or so, he turned left and was now running parallel to the road in the same direction I was heading.  I got a good look at him, but not his face.  I could have probably seen his face had I not been so mesmerized and had the presence of mind to look at it.  I was busy noticing other things.  His fur or hair looked to be about 3 to 4 inches all over the main part of his body.  It was a reddish rusty color.  I was mildly struck by how red it was, but it definitely had some rustyness to it.  He was about 6 feet tall and looked to weigh about 200 lbs.  He ran with a strange Hoppy kind of run.  It wasnt a limp.  With one foot he pushed off with was more a normal running move, but the other foot he pushed off with propelled him upward (about a foot or less) and forward.  I watched him until he disappeared into the woods.  There was a road about 100 yards ahead and I took off to get to it so I could turn right and in 20 yards turn right again to the road that lead to the school parking lot.  So the wooded area he was in was sort of a peninsula and he seemingly had to be in there somewhere. The woods I was looking into from that angle were quite thick and I didnt see him and havent seen him since.  A little farther up on the right was the school garden that had people in it (around 7 - 10) which Im now sorry I didnt stop to go talk to them about it.  The next day as I was driving in to work on the deck, I naturally slowed down in the area I saw him (stopped actually) and was surveying the area when a couple walking their dogs were approaching.  I flagged them down and told the story of what happened the evening before and they told me that about a week before they were with their dogs and were on the way other side of the school property by the soccer field and 3 kids came running over to them saying Did you see the sasquatch, did you see the sasquatch.  They also said that what appeared to be a Dad was with them who didnt seem to excited about it.My conclusion to whether it was real or not is summed up by saying.  It was either real or there was a man in a VERY, VERY convincing costume.I reported it to the fish and game office in Fairbanks a couple days later.  The person who was taking the report was sort of rolling his eyes through the whole thing as he seemed to be writing it down on a piece of scrap paper-.  I even had to ask him to take my phone number just in case."
3,"OBSERVED: From the top of this hill the river was almost visible about a mile away through the darkness. We got out of the truck and stood and looked down toward the river. I was raised in the outdoors hunting, fishing, trapping and watching wildlife. I like to imitate owls at night just to hear them respond to me. As my friend and I stood on the side of this hill I began to hoot to see if any owls would respond from the river bottom. Instead of being rewarded with owls responding to my calls I heard a scream or moan about three quarters of a mile away like I had never heard before. I asked my friend what in the hell was that? He replied that it was probably what some of the old farmhands referred to over the years as the hairy man, which some of them had told of seeing from time to time for many years. I hooted once again and the same scream replied only closer this time. We stood there a little longer and could hear something big coming up the hill through the woods very quickly. By the time we got into the truck we were treated to another hair curling scream still in the woods but getting close to the hayfield. We cranked the truck and drove as fast as we could thru the bumpy field. When we arrived at the gate my friend asked me to get out and close the gate so that nobody could trespass onto the property. The gate was a quarter to a half a mile away from where we were run out of the field. As I opened the truck door to get out I was treated to yet another scream from the hay field. The gate did not get closed that night.     What this was I do not know. I know that there was no livestock kept in this part of the farm. I do know that if this thing were discovered and somehow befriended that it would be a great asset to the U.S. Olympic team, for neither Jesse Owens or Carl Lewis can run cross country like this thing. This incident happened to me in 1985."
4,"OBSERVED: It was a hot afternoon in august. I heard sirens in the distance. the local rescue squad was responding to an incident. curious about what was going on I decide to go and see.when we arrived, I found out that 2 bham men had went canoeing and had not been seen since. the sherrif wanted to call for a helo to search the river. I piped up and told them that in was not a good idea. the trees cause a tunnel affect over the river. the helo wouldn't be able to see under the growth. on top of that the sun was starting to go down. he agreed and sent 6 men in 2 canoes down the river. 30-45 minutes passed and we were told that they had been found at a local bar in b'ham. my friend and I volunteered to pull the rescuers out of the river at a mid point near the road. we set off. the light was almost gone. as we made our way down the trail to a place where the stream and the cahaba meet my friend took off ahead of me. he knew the area better and i could see his light moving ahead of me. as I entered the bottoms where a bamboo thicket grew, I heard brush breaking and grunting noises to my left. I quickley made my way across the stream. I felt much better and safer once I crossed the stream. as I rejoined my friend at the intersection of the stream and river, I told him about what I had heard. he said it was probably a boar rooting for acorns. we sat for about an hour waiting. the moon was out quarter waxing, and hot as hell 100% humidity 90 degrees. after waiting I said to my friend that we must have missed the rescue team in the night. so he went to find out and he left me there on the bank to make sure they were not just slow getting down the river. another 30 minutes went by and I started seeing a light up the bank approaching my position. I pulled myself up into the foliage to camo myself, just in case the light was moon shiners or pot growers. they are notorius for bibb county. minutes passed and I heard my name being called. I made my way back across the stream and through the thicket. the grunting and brush snapping sounds still happening. as I climbed up the hill to the large over hanging rock i paused to catch my breath holding onto the tree. all of the sudden something large much taller than myself( I am 6'8""tall) rushed me. more of the limbs breaking and a vocalization sound like an excited baboon and a fierce growl. My friend was 10' in front of me. we ran quickley away from it. i even jumped a 10' ravine to get away. but it did not pursue further.   "
5,"OBSERVED: I'm really not sure what I saw. I was going back to Birmingham  on interstate 59 exit 166 as I was going down the ramp to get on the interstate this is what I saw I cought something out of the corner of my eye and thought is was an owl but then I releaized that there was no branch there and when this thing looked at me I remember seeing to huge eyes  and it looked like it had it's arm leaning on a tree it was about 6 to 8 feet high and a dark color sort of a grey black blended in with the trees.  I just cought it for a few seconds.. I'm just not sure, I just know it was not an owl.."
6,OBSERVED: I was riding my 4 wheeler about 11 am when I came over a hill by my house on some gas lines. I saw a harry creature standing about 7 1/2 to 8 ft tall staring back at me. It scared me so I reved up the motor and turned the atv around looking back at the creature as I topped the hill I came to a stop. As I watched the animal it seemed to be very calm as it turned and steped off into the woods as if wasn't a bit courious of me being there. That was the first encounter I had with this creature. One of the other encounters I had was this year.  Me and a friend from my church went to my land and found ourselves being chased off the back porch of my house  by a very large animal about 1:30 in the morning.  I'm sure it was the same animal I'd seen years before. I have had two more run ins with this creature no doubt the animal is in this area.  
7,"OBSERVED: It was July 5th 2015 it was late about 3:30am I had fallen asleep on my cousins sofa about 10pm after a long day at our family reunion. All of a Sudden the dogs started going crazy it woke me up so I kinda laid there thinking to myself I wish they would shut up then all of a sudden I heard one of the dogs yell out like it was hurt. Then I heard the sound of something coming up on the front porch so I sat up to look out the front window, it just so happens that we left the porch light on and what I saw was unforgettable and unbelievable. It was squatting down right in front of me I guess it was too big to stand straight up on the porch. I don't know why it was there but we had left the empty beer and soda cans and leftover food scraps in a couple of trash bags to be thrown out the next day. But to make a long story short I was no more than 8 to 10 feet away from it. I looked at for what seemed like an hour but I never saw its face because its back was to me the whole time and I never leave my 45cal but for some reason I did not have it with me. If I had you would have had a corpse to show to the world but this thing has become aggressive in this area of Alabama where my family lives. July 8th it kills my cousins bulldog, in May it chases another family member. June it looks into a family members window in broad open day time so I am trying to get some of the guys together and try and kill it because no one will do anything to research and capture this thing. We know where it lives and how it travels, all we want is for someone to capture and remove it. I live in Texas but my family lives in Alabama, and they are living in fear of this thing so it has to go one way or another "
8,"OBSERVED: Me and my best friend were riding down a dirt road right past the oil well rd. we seen a roughly 7' tall big ""something"" in the road just as our headlights hit it it threw something down and jumped into the woods. we stopped to examine what it was and found it to be a half eaten rabbit. the rabbit was like you had sheared it off with a knife. i saw no foot prints, but i did notice a strange musky odor in the air."
9,"OBSERVED: I saw bigfoot twice in Chance, Alabama and my mom seen him also. He's been living down here far over thirty years. I'm forty seven years old and I remember riding my bicycle through there and hearing all the noise in the woods. I thought it was a big deer going through the woods until I got older. Now I know what it was if you want to see him let me know he's been there from 1980's when I was hearing him and I saw him in 1992 and 2002. One of our cousins said he thinks it was attracted to one of his horses in 2010. I know he's still there."
10,"OBSERVED: Driving on paved road, sighting was maybe 20 yards away, creature exited woods as I crested a hill, crossed right of way and road with four-five strides at incredible speed. 8-9 feet tall, extremely broad shoulders, matted reddish-brown fur. It crossed the road only several yards in front of me, got a very good look at it. I was the only witness and have no evidence, but this is not a case of misidentification. "
11,"OBSERVED: About 7 years ago my wife and I were at a lake in the middle of the talledega national forrest in Alabama.The lake was sweet water lake.We were fishing in a small boat at the end of a slew early in the morning,we were the only ones at the lake, I think it was on a wendsday and we were all alone. We heard somthing scream, it started out as a howl and turned into a long high pitched scream and it was so loud it echoed through the mountians. It made the hair stand up on the back of our necks.But that is not all. About a year before that My stepfather and I were hicking around the same lake,we liked to fish at a spillway way on the backside of the lake,and about 1/2 mile into the hike we crossed a fire brake about 20 feet wide, now keep in mind that we are a pretty good way back in the woods,we have crossed rocks thorns and bryers and all kinds of rough ground. And right there across the dried mud in the fire brake is a set of foot prints dried into the mud.they were not huge they were about the size of a full grown man but they did look human, I just couldn't understand why a man would be this far back in the woods without shoes on.And over the years there is one thing I have thought about a bigfoot would have to grow up, so maybe it was a young bigfoot"
12,"OBSERVED: i had already put one report in , but i thought i would put a separte one in for this. here latly at my house both myself and my parents have heard nioses at night and in the day time around our house. once when my mom and dad were at aunt's house and it was close to dusk i heard what i thought was someone banging on my window. another time i heard what sounded like grunting out side my bedroom window. the other night while my parents and my self were out side we heard a load howl from across the road , we hear what appears to be growling and moaning to but we never see anything. the person who lives across the street says she has never heard it but she is either always gone or either has people over . in fact the other night my parents saw they hear a banging outside the back window. dad said it sounded as though someone wanted very badly to get in. my dog that is in the house never even growled. dad said that it was funny because he said that rocket (my dog) never got out from under the covers , and he heard it because dad said he felt him moving closer to him. one time while i was out feeding my cats at night i heard something running very fast across the road , i never saw anything. there have been serval times that i have heard grunting and rocks hitting the side of the house. my dogs in the back never even bark. i have 2 labs and a mix and he's huge but he never came out of his house  unless someone was out there with him at night. when me and my friend were outside talking one night we heard what sounded like breaking limbs. what ever was jumping or walking on the limbs was huge and when we walked behind the house to see known of my dogs were out and the noise stopped. then as we started back around the house it started again. but as we turned on his spot light the niose stopped. my mom said that she saw red eye crossing the road the other night but could not see anything. one after noon while my aunt , my mom and myself were walking in her small group of trees on her side of the road right in front of house. i walked on ahead and came to the fence that seperated her line from the other owner . i say what looked like one of the teepee formations , but i did not get a good look becuase it was on the other side of the fence. i am not sure that this was one of the teepee that these creature make , but i wanted to metion it."
13,"OBSERVED: It was April of 2011. My son, daughter-in-law, wife and I had been over at my in-laws having dinner. My son and his wife and their infant son had recently moved in with us. We were in the process of adding a new laundry room and garage on the back side of our house. When we came in from next door my son and his family were ahead of my wife and me by a minute or two. I noticed the lights to the new addition were on and figured that one of them had gone out to retrieve their laundry. I opened the back door and said is anyone out there. I didnt yell so I thought they might not have heard me. I stepped out on the patio and started walking toward the garage that didnt have a door hung yet. As I did I saw a dark figure at the back of our SUV. It scared me that there was someone in, or had just passed through our garage. Without saying another word I ran back into the house to get my 410 shotgun and let me son know to join me outside. This only took 30 seconds or less. I went back out but this time I was yelling if there is someone out there you better speak up or I am going to shoot you. My son joined me and we ran out into the yard both yelling for the person to identify themselves. We circled our house and saw nothing. It had rained earlier in the afternoon and evening and as we came back to re-enter our house confident that what I had seen ran away we noticed footprints on the concrete patio deck. These footprints at first looked like that of foot gloves people that fit each toe like a glove does the hand. But the thing that was conspicuous was the size. They were enormous. Not only long but wide, huge like that of what an NBA star might leave. (I say that because I have a pair of shoes owned by an NBA star that my nephew gave me who is on an NBA coaching staff.) My point, these were very large feet and very wide strides. It then dawned on me how large the figure I saw in the garage had to be. As stated I own an SUV and at the back part of the garage where I saw the figure the concrete starts to slope down from the garage. This figure I saw was head and shoulders over the top of the SUV and he (it) was already on the slope because he was not inside the garage when I saw him. I joked to my son and later to my family; you know that thing I saw that night was big enough to be a Sasquatch. We all laughed because we had not heard of any other Bigfoot sightings in lower Alabama. Then your show comes to television and I go on your site today and learn that there was indeed a Bigfoot sighting on Ft. Rucker back in the 90s by a solder. I live just five to six miles from the post. Im not convinced that what I saw should be reported to you but I do know that if it was a person I never want to see them again on a dark night in my yard because they are a very big person. Our house is in a rual country setting in Pinckard, AL with limited neighbors.  "
14,"OBSERVED: In July of 1985 on a hot but clear afternoon I was driving home on County Rd. 21 about 1 mile from my home when up ahead I saw these dark figures approach the side of the road.  They were standing there in close proximity to each other and as I neared them, all the while slowing down my speed, I could see three distinct and different sized figures.  I've lived in the country all my life.  I grew up playing and hiking the whole countryside and I knew the area around my home real well.  I have always loved watching animals in the woods but I did not know what to make of these creatures.  As I neared them, they appeared to be of various heights, about 2 feet or more, 3 feet and maybe 5 feet or more and all had brown black thick looking shaggy hair all over.  I could not see any facial features but they're arms were long for their bodies. They appeared to hesitate as though they couldn't decide what to do as I approached them in my car.  All of a sudden they ran across the road in front of me and vanished into the thick bushes and trees on the other side of the road. They did not stoop over but ran upright and with swiftness.  I was stunned.  They were no animal I had ever encountered before.  I started to slow down and get out of my car, but all of a sudden it hit me.  I've seen something that can't be explained other than these creatures are not normal creatures.  I was spooked and the hair stood up on the back of my neck.  I quickly gassed the car and sped home and told my encounters with these creatures to my husband and sons.  I will never forget this.  I know what I saw and it will always be with me.  "
15,"OBSERVED: 2007 I was hunting on my hunting club land,when some people were shooting guns nearby.I had been watching a greenfield that was on a powerline.The people were hooping and hollering after they shot.It was about 5pm,I had gotten disgusted and was fixen to leave.They were shooting to my far right.I could hear them talking clearly.One of them shot and let out a whoop afterwards.Thats when to my left sort of in front of me I heard a response.It was a loud long whoop,followed by a chatter.I thought it was just the echo of the person.Then it did it again,this time it was further up from my left.I began to watch the tree line and the field.Thats when I could see something on two legs walking in the pines.It was about 200 yards to my left,heading for a break in the pines.Then it stopped and crouched down.A cold chill began to run up my back.Thinking it was another hunter I stood up and began to move. It did'nt move it just sat there by a brush pile.I have been interested in bigfoot for a longtime.I began to walk towards my truck,but it still would'nt move.I returned the next day to look for sign but found nothing.The only thing I noticed was an unusual odor,kind of like a wet deer.Only thing was it had'nt rained in days.I hav'nt said anything till I found your website and saw the eyewitness account in franklin county alabama.  "
16,"OBSERVED: I was night fishing for catfish from a boat dock at the end of a dead end road adjacent to a wildlife refuge. It was middle of summer and the Mosquitoes were really bad so I decided to wait until after dark to go because they usually calm down after sunset. I had been fishing awhile with no luck when I started noticing something moving in the edge of the water, it was a river otter. I had never seen one before so I just sat and watched it for awhile. It was eating something maybe crawfish or muscles, I'm not sure but it was there for quite awhile. While watching it I started noticing large yellow eyes that I assumed was an owl. I would just catch a glimpse of them and when I would turn to look at them they would disappear. This went on for 30-45 minutes. All of a sudden the otter shot away from the bank and I saw something grey move from behind a bush to behind a cedar tree. The distance it covered was about 15 feet and it did it in a second and made no noise. I didn't get a clear look it happened so quick, but whatever it was was big (if it was a side view like I assume from the direction of travel it was thick maybe 2 foot). Within 3-4 seconds after disappearing behind the cedar tree something big hit the water about 5 feet from the end if the dock where I was sitting and a fear came over me like nothing I've felt before. I grabbed my stuff, threw it in the truck and left as fast as I could. "
17,"OBSERVED: I had purchased a fence for my cats and my husband and I had spent most of the day putting it up .We stopped working on it that evening so we could have time to feed the animals-horses,dogs chickens and cats- before dark . By the time we were finished feeding everything it was dark but I had decided to run a cord with a light on it out to the fence and work on it a while longer adding more clips to it . The local high school is about 1 or 1 1/2 miles from our house and they were having a tractor pull that night and I could hear the noise from the tractors .Other than that, it was quiet out . The fence is out close to the barn which has a security light on it . With that light and the light on the cord that I had hanging from one of the tall fence post, the area where I was working was well lit . I had been working for about 2 hours when I heard a noise coming from the woods to my left about 100 or 150 yards away . There is a deer trail that runs through the woods there and the noise I heard sounded like something had caught a deer . I continued putting clips on the fence, not thinking anything else about the noise I had heard and about 25 or 30 minutes later at about 100 yards up from the place I had heard the first noise, I heard something make a loud hollering howling sound . Not wanting to believe what I heard, I told myself that it had to have been the neighbors dog . They have a huge dog that has a hoarse bark . Anyway, I decided it was time for me to go inside . I gathered up my tools and just as I was about to get on the four wheeler, I heard it holler,howl again . This time the sound came from the area where I had heard the first noise, that sounded like the deer had been caught . I didn't take time to turn the four wheeler around . I backed it all the way back to the house, right up to the back door .I jumped off, ran in and locked the door .I was shaking so bad I could barely stand . It was like I was having a nightmare, I couldn't believe what I had heard . I told my husband and we went back out with the gun but we didn't hear anything . I knew what I had heard sounded like the sound the bigfoot made on the programs I had watched on TV and at first I even thought I was crazy for even thinking that that's what it could have been and Iv'e tried my best to convince myself there's no way it could have been a bigfoot but it hasn't worked . My husband keeps saying that he believes I had heard something and that there's a good explanation for it because there's no such thing as a bigfoot . He hasn't been able to give me a good one yet . I have called the local game warden and tried to mimic the sound  I had heard asking him if he knew of any animal in this area that would make this sound and he said no . He did say that the only thing he could think of might be some sort of canine - a coyote or if it was more of a high pitched sound it might be a fox . Please believe me this was no coyote, no fox, no small animal could make a sound like the one I heard . It was 100 or 150 yards away and it sounded like it was standing right behind me . I could tell that it was coming from something very large because of the power behind the sound and the sound it's self was like a loud Ahoooooooo .There's no way anyone could have been in the woods faking this . It was real . This experience has affected me big time . My doors are closed and locked  now day and night - I don't think a locked door would stop it, but I lock them anyway . If I'm at home alone during the day and I need to go outside for anything, I carry a gun with me . Under no circumstances do I go outside at night now . I'm afraid to sleep at night . I'm scared to death here now . I don't know for a fact that what I heard was a big foot but I believe with everything inside me that it was . When I found this sight on the internet and listened to the sounds that had been recorded, I swear to you, I started shaking all over again . It sounded exactly like what I had heard-  Exactly-  except what I heard was very close to  me. This is the bad part of it all - When I called the game warden to tell him what I had heard and ask if there was any animal here that could make this sound, he said some sort of canine maybe . I said ""No Sure, it wasn't any kind of dog or coyote or fox or crane - ( which is what my husband said it could have been-but no it was no crane . I've heard cranes before and they do make a scary sound, but it wasn't a crane.) or any kind of cat , I've never heard anything make a sound like I had heard in real life before. ) He then ask "" what did it sound like?"" I hesitated for a second or two  before  I said "" A Bigfoot "" He said back to me  ""well, like said it could be some sort of canine or something like that."" When he said that, I started crying - I couldn't help myself, I cried and told him that this was no joke that I was serious and that I was scared to death now . I believe he was thinking he had real nut case on the phone crying, telling him how scared she was cause she heard a BIGFOOT in the woods behind her house. I think he got a good laugh out of it anyway . Please believe me every word I've put down on this page is true . There is something in the woods behind my house that hollers, howls and I'm very scared of what it could be . I didn't see what it was and I pray to God that I never do, I did hear it and I also pray to God that I won't hear it again . But with God as my witness this is true . One more thing I would like to say that I have wondered about. I mentioned the tractor pull and I've wondered if maybe the sounds the tractors were making when they would start to pull -the winding up sound of the motors could have been the reason this thing was hollering-maybe it thought there was another one around calling to it but in fact it was the tractors, I don't know. I've thought about what everyone around where I live would be saying about me if they found out that I said I had heard bigfoot in the woods behind my house. If no evidence could be found to show that what I was saying was true, I would have big looney toon wrote across my back as long as I live here, I would be laughed at by everybody. Iv'e decided that I and only I know what I heard and I know how it's affected me -I feel like I've had a close encounter with evil - something I had heard might exist but I didn't really  ever want find out if they did, especially from personal experience . I know that I and only I will have to deal with this feeling and that I don't really care what people here say as long as I know I'm telling the truth . If  somehow someone did this as a hoax, (no way) they did a great job. I'd have to say that they're professionals. No way is this a hoax on my part. I've never been more serious about anything before as I am about this. Because I am so afraid here now, especially at night, I called the game warden back today and asked if could investigate this just to see if there might be evidence that this thing might have been or might still be in the woods here. He said that they hadn't had anyone else report anything  like this but he would check it out. I don't know if he will or not. The answer to my prayers would be for him to investigate it, find it, catch it, and take as far away from my house as he could go. Now that I've wrote all this down and hopefully been able to convince you that this is not o hoax- I only hope that your sight is no hoax!"
18,"OBSERVED:    When I was about 8 or 10 yrs old, I saw a Bigfoot. It was on Green mountain near Huntsville, Ala. It was unpopulated then. Now there are million dollar homes there.   I was on my way home from my uncle's house on a gravel road. I was on one side of a hill. The road went down this hollow and back up the other side. In the ditch line was Bigfoot, about 8 ft. tall with arms that looked like they reached down past his knees. It was slightly leaned foward looking straight at me.     It scared the daylights out of me. So I went back to my uncle's house and told him. He got his shot gun and we went back. It was still there looking at us. Uncle threw up the gun to shoot and I told him we needed to get closer. So we went down the hill and as we did we lost sight.  When we got back up the other side it was gone. "
19,"OBSERVED: A LONG STORY HERE. IT IS NOW MARCH 3, 2007.  I LIVE IN GUNTERSVILLE ALABAMA. I HAVE SPOKE TO SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES JUST AS CONVERSATION. THE STORY IS THIS. ABOUT 15YRS AGO, MY WIFE, AND TWO CHILDREN WERE LEAVING OUR HOME IN HONEYCOMB, JUST NORTH OF GUNTERSVILLE OFF OF HWY. 431 AT THE BOTTOM OF GRANT ALABAMA. WE WERE IN ROUTE TO WAL-MART. ABOUT 8-9PM PROBABLY MID SUMMER. A WELL LIT SEEMS FULL MOON NIGHT. WE LIVED 4MI. AROUND PAST THE LAKE IN HONEYCOMB. I WAS DRIVING MY OLD HOT-ROD A 1964 FORD. THERE ARE SOME PERSONS BY THE LAST NAME OF (NAME REMOVED BY INVESTIGATOR) WHO ALWAYS HAVE DOGS IN THE STREET AT THEIR HOUSE BY THE LAKE. THE ROAD WHITE ELEPHANT RD. RUN BY THE WATERS EDGE IN FRONT OF THEIR HOME. THE ROAD IS ABOUT 4FT OFF OF THE SHORE LINE. THE (NAME REMOVED BY INVESTIGATOR) S HAD TWO ST. BERNARD DOGS ALONG WITH THEIR OTHER DOGS. THAT PARTICULAR NIGHT DRIVING PAST I SAW IN THE WATER WALKING AWAY FROM THE ROAD AND SHORE A LARGE 8'SASQUACHE. I LOOKED BACK IN MY REARVIEW MIRROR, AND STILL TURNED AROUND TO LOOK THRU MY BACK GLASS. MY WIFE SAW MY DISMAY, AND QUICKLY ASK WHATS WRONG, SHE AT THAT TIME LOOKED BACK, I ALWAYS DRIVE SLOW BY THEIR HOUSE AS THE DOGS ARE ALWAYS IN THE ROAD, SO SHE HAD TIME TO LOOK, ALL SHE SAW WAS THE RIPPLES IN THE WATER, AS WE PASSED A FEW TREES. IT WAS A FULL MOON NIGHT, AND NO WIND-CALM WATERS. NOW WHAT I SAW WAS THE 8' SASQUATCH CARRYING ONE OF THE ST. BERNARD HEADS. I IN THE TIME THAT DROVE BY SLOWLY SAW THE BIGFOOT FROM THE KNEES UP, CARRYING THE HEAD OF THE DOG, SOME FLESH WAS HANGING FROM THE NECK AREA. THE HEAD WAS IN THE BIGFOOT'S LEFT HAND. HE WAS CARRYING IT FROM THE DOG HAIR AT THE TOP OF THE DOG HEAD. I SAID TO MY WIFE AT THAT TIME THAT IF ONE OF THOSE DOGS CAME UP MISSING THAT THE SASQUATCH WAS THE REASON WHY. HOWEVER BOTH DOGS CAME UP MISSING AND WE NEVER SAW THEM AGAIN AFTER THAT TIME.NOW STORY UP TO DATE.  TELLING THE STORY TO MANY PERSONS IN THE YEARS PASSING, AS PEOPLE TELL STORIES, I FINALLY TOLD THE GUYS AT THE TVA WHERE I WORK AS A CONTRACTOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT. MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MR. (NAME REMOVED BY INVESTIGATOR) IS JUST KNOWING EACH OTHER FROM THE WINDOW OF OUR VEHICLE AS WE WOULD WAVE TO ONE ANOTHER, AS OUR CHILDREN ROAD THE SCHOOL BUSS WITH EACH OTHER. I FINALLY ONE DAY ABOUT 4YRS AGO ASKED HIM WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS DOGS, AND TOLD HIM THE STORY  OF WHAT I SAW. HE SAID ONE OF THE DOGS DIED IN HUNTSVILLE ALABAMA AT HIS MOTHERS HOME, AND THE OTHER DIED AT HIS HOME IN HONEYCOMB AND HE BURIED IT BEHIND HIS HOUSE. NOW. I DIDN'T PUSH THE ISSUE OF LETTING ME DIG UP THE DOG'S CORPS AS IT WOULD BE KIND OF TACKY. BUT IF YOU GUYS WANT TO CONTACT ME AND SEND SOME INVESTIGATORS TO CHECK AND SEE IF MR. (NAME REMOVED BY INVESTIGATOR) WOULD ALLOW YOU TO DIG UP THE CORPS TO SEE IF ITS HEAD IS MISSING, YOU MAY GET SOME CLUES OR EVEN SOME HAIR FORM THE SASQUATCH. HOWEVER IF THE HEAD IS STILL ATTACHED, THEN I WAS HALLUCINATING THE WHOLE THING, AND MY WIFE WOULD JUST IMAGINED THE WATER RIPPLES TOO. I DONT DO DRUGS, OR SMOKE DOPE, AND DIDN'T AT THAT TIME EITHER.  THE ONLY THING RUNNING THRU MY VEINS IS GOOD WHOLESOME NATIVE AMERICAN BLOOD. I WOULD LOVE TO PARTICIPATE IN PURSUING THIS INVESTIGATION IF THERE WILL BE ONE."
20,OBSERVED: My sighting happened last summer. I was kayaking down a creek. It was about the middle of the day. I was comin down the creek. The creek I was coming down is deep in some parts and shallow in some. There are always deer and turkey moving through. When I came around the curve in the creek a splash happened right in front of me. I thought it may have been a fish. So I kept paddling. Then three more splashes hit by me. The last splash I saw it was a rock. So I slowed down in the creek to look. I started looking in the direction the rocks came from. It was sitting on its knees like a person would. Then it stood up. When it stood up. The hair on back of my neck did. Me and it made eye contact for around 30 seconds. It turned and started running through the woods. I've seen and heard people run through the woods. Its stride was wider than any humans. When it ran it didn't bother dogging sticks and stuff. It just ran through the brush. After that I turned around and started paddling back to my truck. I went back down there that night to see if I could spot light it. I done a howl and waited to see if it would respond. But than I heard two knocks back to back. I knocked on a tree. It knocked back at me. But it was off in the distance. So I couldn't see it.    
21,"OBSERVED: My husband has described a hairy biped that has been seen by him on at least 2 occassions, and by his father on one occasion on Brindley Mountain in Morgan County Alabama. This biped is well known to residents of this side of the mountain. I have always been sceptible, thinking perhaps they are seeing bears or such. My husband is a seasoned outdoorsman however, and he rarely mistakes wildlife. In summer of 99, my husband was clearing land for a family member close to the bluff where sightings were reported off and on. I was sitting on a car watching him in a tree, (hes a tree surgeon). I happened to look off toward the tree line for no reason that I recall, and I saw perhaps several hundred feet off, a tall reddish manlike creature with no apparent neck, standing off in the shadows of the treeline. I looked up at my husband and gestured toward the area. Upon looking back, the creature was gone. My husbands nephew was also sitting next to me, and he saw the same thing I saw. I still to this day wonder what in the world I saw. I know bear, having seen many, and having travelled out west, and this was no bear. Since that incident, my husband was hunting, and he and his father saw from their tree posts the same creature. He would have to tell you the details. He has had I believe one other sighting, but there are many accounts within his family and surrounding neighbors on the bluff. I have heard screams late at night around 2 or 3 am, that no one can match them to any certain animal. They are very similar to sound files we have heard online. Very much like a bobcat/hounddog combo. It is like a howl,scream very loud and drawn out. We continue to watch for further evidence, but have not had or heard of any activity for a couple of seasons to date."
22,"OBSERVED: I was born and raised in Aliceville, Al. about a guarter mile from the City Park. In 1958 I was 14 years old. I played in the woods South of the Park and swam in the creek nearly every day.One afternoon just before dark I had been down near the creek at a small pond.This was before the City built sewer lagoon on that property. At that time there was a twenty or so acre sage brush patch there where they had not cultivated for years.That afternoon while walking from the lake back across the west end of that field I saw something walking a path along the eastern end.At first I thought it to be a huge man. Thatfive foot tall sagebrush was strikeing hin about the waste.It was in plaine sight for about fifty yards and turned and went back into the woods. It must have been 8 ft. tall and walked with it's head slightly bent forward, very dark in color. I could tell it was the same color from waste to the top of it's head.The longer I looked I knew it wasn't human.I ran home and told my parents but I don't think they believed me.I never went in those woods alone again until I was much older.When a friend sent me your site on the net and I saw Aliceville on it I had to tell my story.    "
23,"OBSERVED: First, my friend Mike and I, along with two girls, were at the city park and heard it from bellow from the hill behind us. Three days later we went back again and this time I saw it. I thought it was a tall pole but it looked to be wavering in the breeze that was blowing. I called Mike over to look but it wasn't there. Then it caught my eye. We saw it walking up the hill where we had heard it earlier. My second sighting was at our family farm, three miles away from the first sighting. I and my friend Bill rode out to the farm that evening to check on things since nobody lived in the house there. As we turned into the driveway the headlights swung, and there it stood, stepping over a 5 strand barb wire fence. It had its hands on the top wire and was swinging its leg over. Its eyes glowed in the light like an animals. We left in a hurry."
24,"OBSERVED: I had noted on my Limestone, Alabama Spring 1978 sighting report that I would eventually submit other sightings that involved myself, others I know or did know or had learned from talking with others. I did not know it would be this long to submit them, but I have since married, had a child, lived in three different locations, had five different jobs among other things since I last submitted that Limestone, Alabama sighting.This sighting/encounter below involved myself, and two freinds, it unexpectdly and without intent being my second. The event I relate here happened to me and two friends in April of 1994 while I was attending Troy State University, Troy. I was undertaking graduate studies at the time. I lived in a campus dorm and had become friends with several people in the dorm and about campus. One of these friends stayed in a room a few doors down. He dated a young woman that stayed in the International House across campus. I had been studying on that paticular night I write of and had become bored with it. My friend knocked on the door and came in. I for the most part had an ""open door policy"". The door may be open, but knock before you enter so I'll know you are there. As Kevin and I talked we agreed to go pick up his girlfriend, Donna and go to ""Lookout Mountain"".  I had been out to the place once before during the day about a month earlier so I offered to drive.  We left campus around 11 pm or so. We headed up Hyw. 231 north. About 8 miles from the Campus we turned west/northwest (left) onto Co. Rd. 17   As we got closer to the so-called Lookout Mountian we noticed fewer and fewer houses. After about 15 minutes of driving we had found it and proceeded to park just off the road. We got out of my vehicle and then walked up to the top of this large hill. The hill is about 100 feet high from what I remember. It is supposedly the highest point in Pike County. The place seemed to be a well known and well used spot with open areas about the path to the top, besides one could see for several miles to the west, south and east from atop this hill. I recall seeing the rotating beacon that night at the Troy Airport several miles to the south. I knew we were not the first people to walk to the top and hang out nor were we going to be the last. Everything seemed cool. After about 15 to 20 minutes we three decided to head downhill toward the car and find something else to get into. I think we had decided we were going to go to Subway for a late night snack. Now here is where it got weird. Just after we started downhill I began getting a funny feeling and the hairs started to rise on the back of my neck, like something was there and we were being watched. Seeing how we were out at night in the country plus having a lady with us, Kevin and I had decided not to be foolish. We had both brought along weapons. I had a Colt .38 stuffed in the back of my pants in its holster and a few extra rounds in my pocket plus a good sharp replica Samurai sword. (Yes, a sword). My friend had a Glock 9mm and an extra magazine of rounds. My friend was in the National Guard at the time. I pulled out the .38 before we got even midway downhill. I had looked over to where Kevin and Donna were to my right. He had already taken out his 9mm so I knew he also sensed something by then as well. It was also about this time that we started hearing rather heavy footsteps. As we moved along I notcied the steps were on both sides of us. By the time we had arrived midway downhill we were aware that there were five maybe six...somebodys or somethings out not far from us. I recall that there were two and I'm pretty sure a third distinct grouping of footfalls to my left and two off to my right. Kevin was closest to the ones on my right so I'm sure he had heard them much better. Also by this time our Donna had become almost hysterical. I'm sure her few screams did not help matters much. Kevin said that it might be some other people messing with us like Frat boys. We stopped breifly. He shouted a few warnings that whomever was there had better leave us alone or speak up, he was ready to open fire. No answers. Nothing. I remained quiet, listening. Now any person in their right mind (perhaps even in a drunken state of mind) would have said something in order to keep from being shot at, I would think, yet there were no answers, no response of any sort. Just slience. We then continued to move downhill toward my vehicle but whatever they were kept back a bit and out of our sight and also to our sides yet they kept moving down along with us, not trying to hide their footfalls. As we approached the bottom of the hill we ran for it,  got into the my car as fast as we could,  cranked it up quickly,  backed up, and took off back the way we had came. I am not sure if whatever they were moved out into the dirt road behind us or not as we drove off. I looked back but, it was really too dark to tell. Aside from that the road was narrow and had trees along each side of it and I was being as careful as I possibly could so as not to run off this road. I don't recommend under such cirmstances trying to drive out of such a place and look back at the same time. It took several minutes after we got back onto Hwy. 231 for Donna to calm down. I was shaken up but not too bad. I suppose the driving had something to do with it. I'm not sure how Kevin felt. I assume that his military training had taken over for a time back on that hill. We never saw what they were. Except for the footsteps they were otherwise quiet. At first I was not sure what they may have been however after considering the strange activites I felt they could very well have been bigfoots. I still feel that is what they were though I can never be 100% sure. Even so, what they did while we were on Lookout Mountain would seem much like reported and researched bigfoot behavior.  After a few months and leaving Grad school I eventually lost contact with those two friends. I've not been back to Lookout Mountain since even though I have traveled up and down that part of 231 near there many times. I'm sure with a little driving about those dirt roads off Co. Rd. 17 I can find that hill again. I'm just not too sure I'd want to find it once again at night.  "
25,"OBSERVED: My brother-in-law and myself were walking along a creekbank in rural St.Clair Co. Alabama and we stumbled upon a print that we weren't sure what it was. It looked like a human foot.The print was about a size 9 or 10 in shoe sizes but only about 3 1/2"" wide and was approx. 2-3 deep in the dirt. I tried to replicate the depth with my foot but I had to stomp in the dirt with the heel of my boot to replicate the depth of the print. The print was not a bear or any other wildlife that we have seen in the woods as we are avid hunters. There were 2 prints,1 looked like it was walking out of the creek and stepped up on the bank with just the ball of its foot, then the track beside it was a full print as decribed before.  "
26,"OBSERVED: When I was around 11 years old, I had a strange encounter in the field behind my house.  At that time, I believed I saw a crazy old man, but I now realize that is all I could rationalize it to be.  I was walking alone at dusk with my dog.  This was not unusual as I loved to be outside- my parents often had to force me inside by calling me in for the night.  Well, from what I can remember of that particular night, I was picking up rocks in a ditch and looking at them.  I might have been looking for a certain kind of rock but I can't remember exactly what I was doing.  It was definitely getting dark, but I could still see well enough to keep after the rocks for awhile longer.  I remember holding a stick I was using to pry rocks out of the dirt.  It was very quiet and still and there wasn't much wind.  As I was looking at the ground, I heard a noise in front of me and I looked up to see what it was, and that is when I saw him.  He stood right in front of me at a distance of 5 to 10 feet, he was tall, but hunched and quietly staring right at me.  He wasn't much taller than a normal man, but I got the impression he was old because he was hunching.  He looked like Rip Van Winkle to me, and that is what I thought of when I saw him.  He had a long shaggy beard around his facial area, but he was completely naked but for the long shaggy hair that was in matts all over his body.  I remember the hair was thin at his face, the base of his neck, and upper torso, but thicker around his beard, lower torso and legs.  All the hair was grayish white and very long and shaggy.  Mats of hair dangled from him in tatters.  His feet were bare.  His face was very humanlike, but not quite normal as it had very exaggerated wrinkles- again, a reason I thought he was a crazy old man.  His head seemed normal, but there was so much hair it was hard to make out his features except where the hair was thinner.  He appeared gaunt and thin, but in just a moment I would realize he was not like an old man at all.  I screamed as loud as I could out of fear and I noticed my dog bolted towards the house while I was taking in the sight of this strange thing in front of me.  The shaggy old man let out a scream of his own when I screamed.  He was staring right at me screaming in a voice that sounded like a woman shrieking- he seemed very scared of me as well.  I turned to run for my house.  I looked over my shoulder to see if he was following me and I saw him run up the ditch in the other direction.  He was extremely agile and fast- he was definitely not Rip Van Winkle.  He ran in a full sprint, very quickly for someone so hunched.  I think I caught the dog running back to the house, as I was so frightened.  I remember running into the kitchen and telling my Mom there was a crazy old Rip Van Winkle in the field.  I remember describing how he was old looking, hunched, naked, and his hair was very long and matted like he hadn't cut it in 20 years.  I told her about how he had hair all over his body.  Needless to say, I wasn't believed.  I became obsessed with what I called ""the Shaggy old man"" or ""the Crazy old man"".  I believed that he must have been an old deformed hermit.  I kept a notebook in which I drew many sketches of him.  I remember keeping the notebook secret from my family, hiding it out of fear of being ridiculed.  I wish I had those sketches now but sadly I've misplaced that notebook.  I remember I went back to the spot in the field looking for him on other occasions, but I never ran into him again.  I wasn't aware enough to look for prints or anything like that, but I knew that he was out there somewhere and I wanted to prove he really existed to others.  What changed my opinion of this sighting was a late night visit to a bigfoot website.  I was just browsing their sightings index and I came across several sightings in the same county I lived in and all described white or grayish colored creatures.  Honestly, I didn't realize bigfoot were sighted in this part of the country at that time, or even for most of my life, and just seeing all those other sightings was a revelation.  I realized for the first time that what I witnessed may not have been a crazy old shaggy man, but rather a bigfoot.  When I think back on the sighting, it all makes sense in that light.  There would be no reason for a naked old man to wander that field, much less to be covered in grayish, white, shaggy tattered hair.  The only reason I never thought of it as a bigfoot before was that I had never heard of an Alabama bigfoot, so the thought never entered my mind.  Also, I had never heard of a whitish gray colored bigfoot, and this creature was thinner than a typical bigfoot description- maybe he was older or maybe even younger.  He looked a bit hungry to me, as he was not some hulking powerful creature, but he was still strong looking and extremely agile. "
27,"OBSERVED:  Every year me and a group of my friends camp in cheaha state park. Year before last, we where sitting outside our tent around the camp fire and it was about 11:00 at night. We where the ONLY ones in that camp site, so it was very quiet. We started to hear stange low noises almost like an old chainsaw trying to crank. Following that was a very high pitch humming noise. The sound was getting closer and closer. We took out our spot light and scanned the woods. What we saw was very disturbing....it appeared to be an up right figure, that was hairy and had a grey tent to its fure. It was standing behind a tree and was slightly hunching over, like it was hiding from us. We could see its back bowing out of the right side of the tree and its head coming out of the left. Theirs no doubt in my mind that it was an ape-like creature. It stood still for about 30 to 60 seconds. Then we decided to take the light off of it, to maybe see if it would move....about 10 seconds later we turned the light back on and it was gone! The next night we heard two seperate creatures but neither showed up."
28,"OBSERVED: Not a good writer, but what happened to me and a friend  - we were walking down an old pulpwood road with his german shepherd  and got a strong smell like a goat and stopped my friend. I walked ahead about 20 ft and said it might be a big rattle snake, about that time I heard leaves rustling and it got louder and a tree about 6 inches around shook back and forth about 2 feet each way and I heard the leaves moving like something was running away. I pulled some branches back and there it was, about 20 feet running away on 2 legs at a very fast pace. It was about 8 feet tall and I could see its muscles in its legs moving and the whitish skin under the 3 inch black hair. Long arms no neck as plain as day. My friend never saw it and didn't believe me. But it changed my life. Would like for someone to call me. Two weeks later in the dentist was an outdoors magazine with the Patterson film in it."
29,"OBSERVED: On friday march 12 at around 6pm I was going home from the store and when I started to turn off the highway I noticed something white quating down on the side of the highway near the creek about 30-40 yards ahead of me so at that time instead of turning I went on toward it to see what and if I was really seeing what I thought I was seeing and as I got within about 10 yards of it, it stood straight up and turned around slowly and walked into the woods real calm and at that time I couldn't believe what I had just saw. The thing was very large, dirty white, taller than the street sign that was near, and fury and I could tell it was not human or anything I had ever seen before, it scared me so bad I had tears in my eyes and started shaking and at that time I went straight home and told my husband about it."
30,"OBSERVED: This happened in 1988 in Nauvoo AL.  I was 14 years old. I was at home in my living room watching TV and my brother was outside working on a car. We were the only ones at home.  The front door was located in the living room. We never used this door because we had no steps to it and the door was about 4 feet from the ground. So we used the back door of the house. I was sitting on the couch watching TV when the door began to move and the door knob was turning. The only thing holding the door shut was a nail someone had nailed at the top of the wall and bent it over to hold the door shut. I first thought it was my brother but he knew we didn't use the door. As the door was moving just a little I noticed at the bottom of the door where there was a gap, 3 fingers slide under the door. My heart began to beat faster, I tried to move but I couldn't at first. Then I wanted so bad to look out the window beside the door but I was too scared. These fingers were very long and the nails were long too and black. The hand like finger had hair on it dark brown. The hair was long. This only lasted for 3 min. When the fingers move out from the gap the door knob and the door stop moving. About 45 min. later my brother came inside and I asked him why he was trying to use the front door he said he hadn't. I didn't tell him what happened until sometime later. Because of fear he wouldn't believe me and the fear of him using this to scare me later on."
31,"OBSERVED: I had been visiting a friend one night. It had gotten late and I had to work in the morning, so I got in my car to leave. On my way back to the main road, I stopped at a stop sign. Out of the corner of my eye I saw something moving in the trees. I looked over and an upright figure came out of the woods towards my car. I would estimate it was 7' to 7'5"" tall with dark brown hair with grey patches on the chest and face. I drove away, quickly, because it was coming towards my door. As I drove, in the rear view mirror I saw it cross the road in about 2 steps, then I lost sight of it."
32,OBSERVED: While driving to check on my dogs that were being kept at my aunts house in a fenced in area with a ten by ten out building. An adolescent bigfoot ran out of the woods and into my aunts yard it ran between the house and the garage. It was approximately three and a half to four foot tall. I pulled in to the drive but was to afraid to get out of the car had the feeling that something was watching me from the woods. The dogs were yapping but ok so I left because I was afraid. 
33,"OBSERVED: When I was about 13 years old I went trout fishing with my mother and aunt on the White river in Arkansas.  We were staying at a motel in BullShoals.  One morning we drove to a remote area of the river to fish via an unkown dirt road.  We stopped to fish a bend of the river.  On the opposite side of the river(west), was a tall stone bluff with a slight over crop from erosion.  On the east side was flatter land with 12 to 20 foot thin scrub trees about 20 to 30 feet from the water, as the river was low.  While my mother and aunt where fishing off the bank, I decided to try my luck further up river, about 300 yards away and just out of sight with my mother.  While I was fishing along the bank I began to hear rustling sounds in the trees and shrubs behind me.  I looked in the direction of the noise and could see the tops of the these thin trees moving as if something were walking through them and pushing them to the side, but due to the thickness of the vegetation I could not see what was actually moving the trees.  I stood and observed this activity for 2 or 3 minutes.  I began hearing grunting type sounds that were very deep and substantial sounding.  These sounds were similar but different than grunt sounds a bull would make.  The movement of the trees began to appear as if something were shaking the trees at this point instead of moving through them.  It appeared that whatever was making the noises was only about 10 feet inside the brush yet I could not see what it was.  Feeling nervous, I decided I should return to my mothers side and began walking back towards my mother.  As I did, whatever was in the brush moved with me step for step.  As I walked the movement in the trees seemed more forceful with the sounds of large branches breaking as it moved.  When I got within sight of my mother (about 50 yards), all activity stopped.  I informed my mother there was something in the brush following me, but she shrugged it off.  Within a few minutes we decided to leave as we werent catching any fish."
34,"OBSERVED: I was driving down the road and needed to use the restroom.  I stopped my vehicle and turned my lights and the motor off so I could hear if any other vehicles were coming.  I smelled a very strong odor coming from the road in front of me.  It smelled a lot like a wild hog.  I turned the headlights on and standing approximately 30 yards in front of me was a large hairy creature 7 to 8 feet tall.  It had large eyes and a large mouth and it's hair was very long and shaggy and very dirty.  It had it's arms out to it's side like it was surprised that I turned the lights on.  It's arms were very long, longer than that of a human.  It stood there for a few minutes and then took two long strides into the woods.  I did not look for tracks that night, but came back the next day and did not see any, but the gravel road is very hard and there was pine straw on both sides of the road in the woods."
35,"OBSERVED: The report, as written by the witness:""hellonot sure if this report is worth anything but in the fall of 1983 me and may dad had made a hunting trip for turkey as we did every year. we got to the woods which border the mississippi river and parked it was bout 4.00am. we started toward the woods in pitch dark without flashlightsand as we got half way to the woods this god awful scream came out of no where. it was if what ever it was seemsd like it was just in front of us. my dad at the time was 68 yrs old and had been in the woods all of his life. he ha never shown fear in all of our years hunting but at that time he was visabally scared as i was. i wanted to turn and go back to the truck parked under a light next to the sun gas line terminal which was bout a 100 yard back. but then we heard the scream again. it seemed like a baby crying and woman screaming all together at the same time. well i could tell my dad wa scared and we made it tp the edge of the woods and we set tite till the sun came up. then we mooved down the woods for bout a 1/2 mile and heard the screams 3 more times it seemd like it was shadowing us down the bottom. well i saw my dad that day jump a 4 wire barbed wire fench and we got to the truck and we havent been back there since. which we always you to hunt turkey and run our beagles back there. cant say for sure what it was as we never saw any sign or tracks but my dad stated in all of his years in the woods he ha never heard such a sound. this happened in west memphis ark at the foot of 8th street landing"""
36,"OBSERVED: In May 2001, my wife and I were traveling from Pine Bluff, AR to Watson,AR, a town 16 miles east of Dumas, AR. It was late at night, about 1:00 a.m. I don't remember the exact date but it was late May. I'm not from this area and my wife's relatives had told me about sightings in the past. I wasn't convinced. However, on this night my attitude changed. My wife, of course, was asleep so I'm the only one that saw it. We were about five miles outside of Watson on Hwy. 1  when suddenly I saw a tremendous blur of white about 30 yards in front of the car. It was a large animal or man at least 7 feet tall tearing across the road. I yelled at my wife, ""did you see that?!"". Of course, she did not. But I believe what I saw to be a bigfoot or sasquatch."
37,"OBSERVED: I WAS GOING UP TO HARDY AR.TO LOOK AT SOME LAND I HAVE ON WHITE HORSE MT. THE ROAD UP THERE IS GRAVEL. AS I WAS COMING AROUND A BEND IN THE ROAD I SAW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A BLACK BEAR IN THE ROAD. I HONKED MY HORN, THEN A FEMALE BIGFOOT CAME OUT FROM BEHIND SOME TREES PICKED UP WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A BEAR BUT WAS A YOUNG BIGFOOT. YOU COULD TELL IT WAS A FEMALE BECAUSE IT HAD BREASTS. SHE WAS A DARK BROWN ABOUT 7 FT TALL THE BABY WAS DARK BLACK. SHE WALKED OUT FROM THE TREES PICKED UP THE BABY AND WENT BACK IN TO THE TREES. I MUST SAY I WAS SCARED. I OPENED MY DOOR TO SEE WHERE SHE WAS GOING WHEN A SMALL ROCK HIT MY CAR FROM BEHIND ME. I TURN TO SEE ANTHER BIGFOOT ABOUT 6 FT FROM MY CAR. THIS ONE WAS BIGGER ABOUT 9 FT TALL . THE BIGFOOT YELLED AT ME WITH A SOUND LIKE I HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE, I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS. THIS WAS LIKE NOTHING I HAVE HEARD OR SEEN IN MY LIFE.  I GOT BACK IN MY CAR. IT WAS STILL BEHIND MY CAR THEN IT WALKED ACROSS THE ROAD AND  INTO THE WOODS. I DROVE UP THE ROAD ABOUT 150 YARDS, STOPPED AND GOT OUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I JUST SAW I WAS SCARED AND CONFUSED STILL LOOKING TO SEE IF I MIGHT SEE AND HEAR WHERE THEY WENT. WHEN I GOT MORE ROCKS HITTING MY CAR AND AROUND ME FROM WHERE THE BIG BIGFOOT WENT IN TO THE WOODS. I COULD HEAR HIM. I DON'T THINK HE WANTED TO HURT ME BUT HE WANTED ME OUT OF THERE. THIS HAPPENED EARLY MORNING IN 2008, JANUARY I BELIEVE I SEEN A FAMILY OF BIGFOOTS "
38,"OBSERVED: Several friends and myself had gone together to purchase 120 acres of cut-over forest land that was totally surrounded by several thousand acres of timber company land.  This land was at the end of a small valley, and at the far end of a dead-end road.On my portion of the land was a small rise in the northern half of the valley, and I was building a shack to be used for hunting and camping.  One night,about 8:00, while working inside by lantern light, I decided to step outside on the deck for a cigarette.  As soon as I lit my lighter, a roaring, crackling scream commenced from the slope of the ridge to the south; about 300 yards away, but in direct line of sight.  I was too startled to do anything but stay rooted to the spot and feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck; something which hasn't happened to me in years.  While the scream lasted for only a couple of seconds, it seemed to go on much longer.Since it was very cloudy and dark I ran inside for a flashlight, all the while wishing I had brought my rifle inside from the truck.  With a flashlight and a hatchet I headed for the truck only to find that the truck itself seemed to be moving.  In the bed of the truck I found my German Shepherd ( I had forgotten all about him.) curled in a tight ball in the corner and shaking so hard he was moving the whole truck.We left immediately.Several nights later, one of the friends who had laughed at me when I told the story came out to see how I was progressing with the shack.  He laughed more at the extra lanterns I had placed inside and outside, and at the pistol and shotgun I had laying on the table.  We stepped out onto the lit deck and almost immediately the same grating scream came from exactly the same spot on the south ridge.  In a flash my friend was standing back to back with me as we stared out into the dark.Since the dog was not with us, and because we were armed and had good flashlights, we stayed there for two more hours, but heard nothing else.  But I was certainly glad to have a witness this time.Several weeks later my friend and I ran into one of the other property owners and were relating the story to him when I noticed him becoming a bit pale.  He finally told us that he had been burning piles of deadfall on his part of the property - that butts into the south ridge - and was walking back and fourth to the stream to get water to put out the several fires when he heard something walking around him in the woods.  It was too dark to see, but he at first assumed it was a deer or maybe a bear.  After he had listened for awhile he decided it sounded like a two-legged creature and believed it was one of us trying to play a joke on him.  So he continued putting out his fires while listening to whatever it was make a circle around him.  But when it got upwind from him he began to smell a terrible odor that he admitted scared him so badly that he got in his truck and left, ignoring his still smoldering fires.I cannot say what it was that we heard, or what the other man smelled. But I have heard several kinds of big cats, bears, howler monkeys and other large animals in my years hunting and in the Army, and I have never heard anything that sounded remotely like what was heard those two nights. "
39,"OBSERVED: I was squirrel hunting/scouting for deer signs when I came to the top of a small hill.  About 50 yards below me was a large, dark colored creature walking on 2 legs following a fence row.  I  watched it for about 8-10 seconds before it disappeared. I didn't think to compare it to any tree branches to see how tall it was, but it was at least 6 to 7 feet tall. I didn't follow it at the time, I have to admit I was scared.  I came back later, but couldn't find any traces or tracks because the ground was very hard. "
40,"OBSERVED: A tall (7-8 feet) furry creature was observed walking (on two legs) across the highway, at the outer limits of the high beams on my car. As we passed the spot where the creature crossed the road, we saw saw a 7-8 foot creature with semi-shiny, reddish brown fur standing at the side of the road; it was semi-concealed by some branches. "
41,"OBSERVED: I was gathering some firewood from a stack of previously split wood behind my house. I kept hearing a strange ""whooping"" sound coming from the thick woods about 100 yards away. My nearest neighbor has horses which I could hear bolting away about the same time. My dog ran to the edge of the woods and kept barking and running around back and forth in that area. I have never heard these kind of sounds before. It was after dark about 9:00 pm. I also could faintly smell a very odd smell. Strangly enough the smell reminded me of a zoo. The incident lasted about one or two minutes. I believe that I was being watched."
42,"OBSERVED: I was duck hunting on the White River in Arkansas from a blind. I saw a large hairy apelike creature across the river flipping over stones and walking oddly. About 100 yards away at the closest. I am a former MARINE, I have hunted in Arkansas for 25 years, and I have never seen anything like that before."
43,"OBSERVED: Back in 1969 when I was twelve years old my mother and oldest brother saw a creature while we were camping that changed our whole outlook concerning Bigfoot. This is our story'It was friday afternoon and my family was all excited about going on a weekend camping trip.My dad got off work a little early and we my mother,five brothers and my sister had the truck packed so there was no delay in leaving when dad got home.AS we were heading down our street,My great Aunt stepped out to the curb in front of her house and waved us down.She found out where we were going from my mother earlier that day,Instead of telling us to have a good time she warned us not to go.She said a few weeks earlier she and my uncle had gone to the same place we were going,and were fishing on the river when suddenly she saw a hairy face peering at her threw the bushes as she fished.It scared her and she began calling for my uncle It must have scared the creature because it ran away very fast.When she told my uncle what she saw,He just called her a crazy old woman.But took her home anyway.Well upon hearing what she just said,my dad laugh and told her we would keep an eye out for her booger.We arrived on the river in plenty of time to set-up the camp and have supper before it got dark. Soon it was dark and my brothers were across the road from the camp about 50 yards away fishing for catfish,they were my three older brothers.The rest of us sat around the camp fire planing the next days activities.my dad was listening to the radio and my mother,sister and two younger brothers was going to bed in our tent,the family dog was with us and acting kind of strange all evening.I was not ready for bed yet so i took a little walk down the dirt road about 100 yards or so from the camp.the moon was out but with all the heavy trees near both sides of the road it was to dark to see more than twenty feet infront of me ,when suddenly my hair stood up all over me,I turned around fast and ran back to the camp.Thinking my aunt might be right about what she saw I decited to go to bed,laying there for a while before falling to sleep.The next morning I got up from bed feeling great and along with my family we had a wonderful day fishing,swimming and just enjoying the great out-doors.Soon it was saturday night and my brothers was back fishing for them catfish across from the camp.My dad was listening to country music on the radio and my mother and the rest of family was heading to bed.I was very tired from the activities of the day and decited to go to bed as well it was around 9:00 pm.A half hour had pasted and the dog was acting scared about something and to my suprise he unzipped the bottom section of the tent and climbed in with us.So we let him stay in the tent to settle him down,my mother went out side the tent behind the truck to take a leek,suddenly she began screeming I jumped up to look out the window to see my mother running to my dad around the truck saying it was watching me over and over agan.AS we all ran to my parents,my brothers fishing on the river also came running.My dad told everyone to start packing up'we are breaking camp.My oldest brother stood guard with a pump-shotgun while we made record time loading the truck,then my brother started shooting at something and yelling the dam thing is circling the camp.As we all were loading into the truck my dad and older brothers found strange footprints near the truck where my mother saw the creature standing.The footprints was 14 inches long and 8 inches wide and had onley three toes on each foot.WE were all so scared and went home right then.The next morning my aunt came up to our house to check on us' when she saw our still scared facesshe knew we also had a run in with that creature.she and my mother got together and along with my brother they compared what each other had seen, it was white in color red glowing eyes and had a pointed head. about 6 to 7 feet tall and had long arms.needless to say we are a little picky about were we go camping anymore."
44,"OBSERVED:  In the summer of 1986 my brother and myself where driving home from Paris on Hwy 22. I was driving and my brother had fallen asleep. I was driving east just about 1/4 of a mile east of skating rink road. I was watching the roadway when a large reddish brown animal ran in front of my car. I barely missed the creature. I clearly saw that it was on two legs and had long fur as we went by.  I slammed on my brakes and screamed out when I had first saw it. My brother startled awake and I asked him if he had seen that. He did not. I looked in my rear view mirror but did not see the creature anymore. I have had several animals run in front of my car from horses, cows, deer and once a pig.  I played over what I had seen over and over and realized that it wasnt any animal I had ever seen before. I know it was huge bigger than a man."
45,"OBSERVED: I was six at the time. my family on a bus comingfrom memphis ark. to ft.smith ark.sister and I was in back of bus on the long seatso we could sleep.bus driver stopped bus to use the woods.he jump back in bus and said hold on every bodythere is a big ape out there that almost got me.as the bus started to move my sister and I lookedout the back window and saw what I beleive to bebig foot crossing the road. at the time I didntknow about big foot so we thought it was a ape that had excape from a carnival.it looked like an ape that we had seen in a carnival once. it took long strides crossingthe road and was not leaning over on its handsto walk. it was more like a real big man in a apecostume. the picture til this day is still freshin my mind. and it wasnt an ape that I have everseen in zoo,s or carnivals"
46,"OBSERVED: I was driving around the backroads of fouke and the jonesville area, it was a saturday late evening just before dark. I was looking over all the damaged trees that were still down from the Ice storm we had in this area during christmas.As I came near boggy creek it was getting somewhat dark, so I decited to turn around and head back home.I pulled into a dirt drive in front of a hunting lease to turn around and suddenly I heard a Howling sound like I never heard before.It was then dark to where I could not see threw the trees anymore so I decited to get home.Later on I was able to listen to some sound recordings of bigfoot and just as I thought, I got a rare chance to hear the real thing."
47,"OBSERVED: I am a native of this area. I am an experienced woodsman and this is my first siting at the age of 38. It occured on county road 32 east of Cove AR. I came around corner it was standing on left side of road. It immediately turned its face away from me and was standing there. As I got behind it, it was between nine and ten foot tall and three foot wide at shoulders. Its fur was the same color as the dirt road it was on. I drove past it and was as close as 6 foot to it. It kept its face turned away from me the whole time. I drove away in disbelief and shock."
48,"OBSERVED: It was late summer at my grandfather's cattle farm. My grandfather owns XX's of acres of property in Pope County, in the city of Russelville. He lives on a small corner of his property on about XX acres of land on which he grazes his cattle. One night when were sitting on the porch of his trailer home, we noticed that something was disturbing the cattle. The ""Brem"" Cattle that were usually calm and scattered by the barn on the far side of the property, came running to the fence as they usually did when threatened by a Coy dog. Without giving it a second thought we hopped in the truck, grabbed the night vision binoculars and the high beam and started around the perimeter of the grazing land. We saw nothing until we came down near the pond where the cattle were watered. At first, we missed it with the night vision goggles because it was so still. But when we ran the light through the trees, we caught the glare from its eyes looking right at us. It was too far up in the trees to be a deer or a coy dog and the eyes were too big to be an oppossum or coon. We trained the light on its eyes and as we scanned down the tree, we saw what looked like a very large man leaning very still against the tree. He was huge, around 8 feet tall with black hair and eyes. His hair covered every inch of his body except for his face which was slightly less hairy around the eyes and forhead. I saw him first because I was using the high beam to scan the tree line and brush for eyes. I was too afraid to say anything and by the time I finally found the words to say and pointed grandpa in the right direction, the creature had turned and walked away. The next day we went to look where the creature was standing, but we found no prints because of the shale that was used to form the levy for the pond. "
49,"OBSERVED: I was on my way to work just before day light, it was starting to get light, when I saw something moving out of the corner of my eye across an over grown farm field. I hit my brakes to get a better look thinking it might be a deer. What I saw was about 7 feet tall weighing about 300 to 350lbs running on two legs fast. It was not light enough to get a better look. I came to a stop to watch it run into the woods, I was about 75 feet from where it disappeared.  I tried to see where it was going to come out at but never got a second look."
50,"OBSERVED: I previously sent you an e-mail of this experience, but it occurred in the fall of 1994. We had just moved into our home here and the deer were always coming up to our back fence and causing these little wimp dogs of mine to go into cardiac arrest, esp. at night when I was trying to go to sleep. So I was in the habit of taking a small rifle and shooting a round into the trees to frighen the deer away and shut the dogs up. One night I decided to take my single shot, break-over 410 into the woods on trail to really scare them away. So carrying a flashlight, the gun (broke open , 1 round loaded) and two more rounds, I went off into the woods. About 30 yds into them, I heard movement to my right at about one o'clock, shining my light at the brush, I saw the thing standing stock still. I could tell it was about 7ft. and it was half again as broad across the shoulders as me. I'm 6'1'' and 300lbs so I'm not a little fella by any means, but I was next to this thing. It had a brownish- orange long fur over what I could see of it""s body and it's face was dark. My light reflected in it's eyes like an animal.  At that time it grunted and made to move towards me. Being a redneck, the first thing I did was to close the gun, aim and fire. I know I didn't miss because he was only about 30 to 35ft away and I saw fur fly. It yelled and began to move towards again and began to walk backwards, reloading the gun and never taking the light off of it. I fired again, not missing and he really started move on me , so I did this one more time, this time firing one handed. I turned and ran from the woods to my house. My wife was on the back porch when I came out of the woods and I yelled for her to get my 8mm rifle. She met me with it, I spun around, fully expectng to see this thing on me. It wasn't there. I could here it running through the woods, which isn't easy with all of the under growth here. It let out a long loud ""warbeling"" yell that reminded me of sounds yo might hear at the primate house at the zoo. "
51,"OBSERVED: I was in the Arkansas Ozarks this fall just touring around checking out different streams to fish. I had gone into the Richland Creek area and parked in the primitive campground. I was alone and didn't see anyone else here at that time. Anyway I found a trail and took it heading downstream from the campground. I had read that there were bears in the area so I really payed attention to my surroundings. It had rained the night before leaving the trail wet and it seemed that no one had been on the trail that day due to the lack of footprints. I left the trail two or three times to climb down into the creek to fish. It was very rocky terrain. I had gone about a mile down from the camground on the trail. When I got down into the creek I noticied a small area of very small gravel about 5 by 10 feet on the edge of the creek and decided to look for animal tracks. I saw four round prints in a small group that were not very detailed in the soft gravel. Then I saw a very large, 18 inches or more, print looking very much like a foot right on the edge of the water a few feet away from the other prints. This ""footprint"" was about 4 inches deep and full of water. It lacked any detail in the gravel except that it had very definite, entire edges and was shaped like a human foot. Well, I reached for my camera to shoot it, then I laughed to myself thinking people would think I was crazy. I mean at the time I did think it was funny and I discounted it on the spot. I did look around for more prints but the rest of the creek bed in the immediate area was solid rock. I had a long drive ahead that day and blew it off. It wasn't until I got back home to Dallas that I really had to stop and wonder about what I had seen. I felt like an idiot for not photographing it! I haven't been able to come up with a logical explaination for it such as an animal digging or a tipped over rock. Nothing. I told a few friends about it. I guess some people considered me sane still. My older brother seems to think I've been in the outdoors enough to know what I'm looking at. Who knows?"
52,"OBSERVED: I got up one morning in August and decided to walk next door to my mother's home.  When I walked through the bedroom door, I noticed that she had a gun lying next to her on the bed.  She immediately began telling me that something had been outside her window the previous night.  She stated that she felt someone watching her and she then heard movement outside her bedroom window.  She then described a smell to me.  She said that it smelled like a cross between a wet dog and a ""pole cat"" (skunk).  I wasn't exactly sure what to think so I walked outside and began to look around.  Right outside of my mother's bedroom window was the most exact footprint.  I was shape like a human footprint but with no arch, like someone flat footed.  I measured the print and took photos.  It was 17 inches long and approximately 7 1/2 inches wide at the ball of the foot.  It was very distinct."
53,"OBSERVED: At around 9 p.m. at night, I was standing outside of my house in rural Washington Co., AR right near the Madison Co. border.  While standing in the yard, I heard a noise from the woods north of my yard (16 acres of my 24 were wooded) that sounded like a hooting/deep throated howl coming from the tree line.  This noise occured about three times withine a 15 second time frame.  At the time, my wife had just left the property about two weeks prior, and I briefly considered the noise to be made by my grandfather, who lived next door.  I shouted toward the tree-line, ""Hey, that's a good way for an old man to get shot!""  Afterwards, the hooting/howling occured twice more.  My dogs, two coonhounds, a rat terrier, and shephard mut, all bolted from the porch and headed to the treeline, barking and growling as if they saw something.  I ran to the house and grabbed my .22 rifle.  Running out the front door and angling west along the tree line, I noticed my dogs ""dogging"" something along the woodline, with the brush and tree limbs thrashing.  I followed this ""thrashing"" line of of brush approx. 1500 along the woodline in the pasture behind my house.  As I tramped along, I realized that my dogs were still barking vehemently, yet they were still in the confines of the yard.  I was alone along the tree line with my brush-thrashing guest in the dark.  I paused and observed the continued ""limb thrashing"" progressing toward the west of the property.  Also, during this run, I could hear thumping footsteps as if someone were wearing heavy boots.  In sudden realization of my potential vuneralbility, I returned to my house, where-upon I immediately phoned my next-door grandparents.  My grandmother answered the phone.  I said, ""That was really funny!""  She said, ""What?"" I told her of my theory of my granddad hiding in the woods to scare me.  She said, ""Well, he's sitting right here, ain't been out all night.""  Indeed, I spoke with him, and he certainly did not have time to make it back to the house and decrease his rate of breath (75 yrs. of age) within that time frame.  I believe that I walked out of the house and disturbed an exploring sasquatch."
54,"OBSERVED: Well this happened twice in our area, which is on the navajo reservation in the northeast corner of Arizona. Mid winter in 1979 myself and other neighborhood kids were playing in a recently fallen snow, and out of the darkness  was heard the most terribly and interesting scream that we've ever heard and this scream lasted for about 15 minutes on and off. Now at the time I remember their being reports of a giant Yei Men taking sheep from corals, but I didn't believe until that night. The time must have been about 12 pm.  What is ironic about this incedent is that it did not only happen once but twice three years later in the same conditions. And, their were low key rumors at the time. Now this hasn't bothered me but I sure would like to know how it ever wandered into our region for a fact. In our oral history our elders spoke of  Yei Men of  whom will come and take you away if your bad. I mean just put two and two together?  Now this had to be a Bigfoot, because on several recordings, the sounds are identical to what we heard that night!  And, even on an episode of sightings the night cry was identical. This just gives me the creeps, to know that at that time we were probably  being watched."
55,"OBSERVED: One summer morning of the year 1989, myself and a forestry technician were just finishing up a routine spotted owl survey in the northern part of the Chuska Mountain range.  After calling for owls at a call point, just before sunrise, we began to walk back to the vehicle when we heard a loud, deep yell/roar from down below our position.  The habitat was a mixed conifer stand within a deep dark canyon.  Since there are sheep camps throughout the Chuska Mtn. range, it did cross our mind that perhaps someone (a human) was yelling but the distinct factor that myself and the technician had agreed upon was that the yell was very deep and long (lasted approx. 5 seconds). After the vocalization, the echo itself retained the deepness of the sound as it travelled through the canyon below us.  This was definately not a human that had the lung capacity to make such a sound.After researching it a bit more recently, about sasquatch sightings, audio clips etc., my theory is the animal, whatever it was, may have been responding to our sounds, since we were calling with the imitated vocalization of the the Mexican Spotted Owl.  I've listened to several audio clips of recorded sasquatch vocalizations and can see where one may have mistaken us for another creature of its kind."
56,"OBSERVED: It was our annual summer camping trip and I was in the back of the car with my uncle.  My grandmother and grandfather were in the front and my grandma and uncle were sleeping.  I was staring out the side window and slightly forward.  While looking I saw a large animal that I thought was a bear.  It was only a very brief view but the animal was walking upright and was very furry.  I mentioned to my grandfather that I saw a ""huge bear"" walking upright but he laughed and said it must have been trying to climb a tree.  But there was a break in the trees where I saw the creature.  It looked like it was going off of the side of the road into the forest.I cannot be sure what it was.  But, it was so very odd that it certainly looked like it was ""walking"" on two legs.  It was dark so I couldn't distinguish any other features."
57,"OBSERVED: It was 6PM and I was supposed to meet my wife at FR 115 (**** mts away) at ****.  My son and I were just getting ready to leave the campsite.  As soon as I stood up from my chair, I saw what looked like a VERY large man in a ghillie suit walk across the opening in the trees to my left.  I had a clear sight and it was VERY large.  I could see the arms swaying, and my son was able to see the legs separate as it stepped.  It didn't seem to be in any rush, and seemed to be walking rather casually (kinda slow) but it covered a lot of ground in very few steps.  As I said, I could see both arms swaying, and it was not carrying a rifle or anything else that I could see.  Hunting season had been over for at least a week, and the next one wouldn't start up for months.  At this time, there was almost nobody out here, and nobody knew where we were.  I had my son stand where it had walked, and the top of his head would have been where it's shoulders where.  My son is 6 ft tall.  If it had been a man in a ghillie suit, the guy would have been at least 7 1/2 feet tall.  "
58,"OBSERVED: My brother, Sister, Nephew, my daughter, and I were on our 08 archery hunt in the Kaibab national forest on the North side of the Grand Canyon. We camped down the road from where our family had a prior experience that was reported under incident #13964. On Friday night at about 9 pm my sister and I walked down the road from camp and made several vocalizations including a howl and several whoops to try and ilicit a response. After trying for about 30 minutes without any return calls we walked back to camp. When we arrived my sister took my daughter and nephew and went into the camp trailer to put them to bed.Just as they got into the trailer the excitement began. My brother and I were sitting around the camp fire talking when we heard what sounded like a large branch being broked off of a tree violently with a loud crash or something stepping on a large branch and breaking it. It was so loud that it caught both of our attentions. We acted nonchalant about what occurred and just tried to listen for anything else and talked. For the next 30 minutes or so we listened as the camp was circled by two separate unseen things. They were not being very stealthy and were actually very loud and destructive as far the trees the were hiding in. The one would pace from the north west side of camp to almost passed the north towards east and the other paced back and forth behind the camp trailer that was behind us. Sometimes we would here what sounded like a smaller tree being shaken, or heavy foot steps inside the tall grass. We could tell that there were two of them as some times we could hear both at the same time doing different things. Then the rocks and sticks started being thrown. The first the two of us heard was a stick thrown on top of a tarp being used for shade next to the trailer. then we heard almost a continous volley of small rocks and sticks being thrown at different points around the camp site. The largest rock that was thrown landed on the ground between us and the camp trailer. It was the size of a softball and when it hit the thud sound it made scared us both. Soon after this we both lost our nerve and decided to go into the camp trailer where there was more cover between us and them. When we got into the trailer my sister and nephew were still awake and told us they could hear everything we heard from inside. My sister added though that she could hear what sounded like foot steps behind the trailer the whole time and she said at one point she heard a loud heavy sigh. She also described hearing branches being broken behind the trailer and either rocks or small twigs being thrown at the camp trailer. My nephew verified her account and we all tried to go to sleep.Shortly after turning off the lights we all heard a loud metallic thud. Just outside the door of the camp trailer was a sheet metal box with food in it on a small table. The noise sounded like either something had knocked on the box or threw something hard at it. We all fell asleep quickly except for my brother who could not sleep. He stated for a good time later he continued to hear things being thrown at the camp trailer. He eventually did fall asleep but was awoken some time in the early morning to what he described as a branch object being being drug across the canvas top of the trailer over his head. Whatever it was it passed from one side of the trailer to the other. The next day was uneventful as we did not try to make any calls. My nephew had made himself sick he was so nervous from the night before. We also had rain that night and another hunting group had moved in about a mile down the road. on Sunday night my sister and I again went off down the road to try making calls. This time we went off down the opposite side. We repeated our attempts that we made on Friday and still had no response. We returned to camp and sat around the fire for about 30 minutes without any incident. We then went to bed. During the night as we slept something approached the campt trailer and shook it violently at least 6 times spread out throughout the night. I can say it was not the wind as the trailer did not sway to one side from being blown but it felt like something grabbed the side of the trailer and twisted it from side to side in both directions very violently. All of the three adults felt this go on throughout the night. My brother also described that at about 1200 midnight he heard a low growl that lasted about 10 seconds. He described it as subtle but strong as he could feel the vibrations produced by the sound and he said it felt like it was shaking him slightly. The next morning we left to go home. During the weekend we checked the camp trying to find sign or prints. The ground around the camp was covered with a thick layer of oak leaves and pine needles. The only thing we found were the small 3-4 inch sticks and small rocks that were used to pelt our trailer.  "
59,"OBSERVED: My daughter was visiting from out of state although she grew up here in Flagstaff.  We decided one day to spend time with one of our hobbies which is photographing panoramic landscapes in Northern Arizona.  We spent the morning in Sedona photographing the red rock country but as usual this time of year the monsoon thuderstorms came up around noon and we went back to the house to relax a bit. We did have significant storms in the area that day but late in the afternoon things began to clear up and we decided to head to one of our favorite spots for sunset photography.  This was at the Arizona Snowbowl lower parking lot.  The area from the parking lot to the west starts with a large lush green meadow before falling away into forest, meadows, and rolling hills (cinder cones)that stretch from Hart Prarie some 80 miles to the Grand Canyon.  We set up our cameras anticipating a beautiful sunset and great opportunities to take pictures.  there were a number of people in the parking lot area (10-15). A minute later two hikers started from the parking lot down through the meadow and I remember hoping that they wouldn't be standing in that meadow when I wanted to take a photo. As they traversed the meadow and passed out of sight we heard a single coyote sound off in their general vicinity. As the sun sank towards the horizon and we were getting ready to start taking pictures the two hikers came back from out of the woods and up through the meadow nearly to the parking lot. At that moment we heard a scream from the forest several hundred yards below us.  There were people in the parking lot and two motorcycles idling right next to us.  The scream was so loud that not only did we hear it well but one guy on a motorcylce looked at his companion (with motorcycles running and helmets on) and said ""did you hear that-what the hell was that ?"" We know that most people in that parking lot heard this scream. As the sun was now setting in a glorious fashion with thunderstorms around and off into the distance we got busy taking pictures.  As the sun set and twilight began to overtake things most of the parking lot had emptied out except a pickup load of people had just showed up and they were half drunk and wandering around making noise.  It was getting close to dark and once again we heard this scream from the same general area of the forest below us.  The people from the truck said - "" what the heck was that - a mountain lion ?"" and began to laugh and talk nervously - I just wanted to say to them ""please shut up"" since if any other noises were made they would have been difficult to hear above their drunken mumbling and laughing. Finally they left - it was now dark, we hung around for a bit but not long and heard nothing more.  This was not a mountain lion scream or anything else we could even begin to identify.  It sounded somewhat like a scream a human could make but the distance it was travelling was significant.  It started kind of low and built up.  To us it sounded like the voices of 15 people all starting at the same split second and roaring the exact same note.  It had a quality that one human could just not make, both by the volume and the effect of sounding like a group but clearly being one single scream or roar.  "
60,"OBSERVED: On a cloudy, cool day I went for a hike at Hart Prairie on the San Francisco Peaks outside of Flagstaff, AZ.  It was August, but the monsoon season was in full effect and it was a cool day for Arizona.  I hiked up slope from FR 151 towards the Snowbowl Ski Resort.  The area has springs and so the plant diversity is high and the wildflowers were at their peak.  Being a cloudy, cool day I kept an eye out for wildlife which would normaly bed down at midday in August, though I did not see anything other than various songbirds and raptors.  I had been in the area maybe two hours but as I like to wander around slowly (I see more that way) rather than ""hike"" from point A to point B at a quick pace, I had not covered much ground in that time.  I was at the edge of an aspen grove when I heard a loud howling from up slope and a little to the east of me in the direction of the ski resort.  My first thought was that it was a foreign tourist goofing off.Because Snowbowl has a paved road to it and the views are awesome, tourists from all over the world on their way to the Grand Canyon stop at Snowbowl and many hike around as it is a beautiful and inviting area.  So I thought I was hearing a human.  But I wasn't so sure after the next howl- I was really puzzled.  The sound seemed somewhat human-like and the volume, though  quite loud, wasn't too extraordinary- I could possibly howl that loud, though it would be hard to do without real strain and the sounds I heard were almost casual- no hint of any strain.  But it seemed to be an unusually weird sound for a human to make.  Almost as if the human had a deformation of some kind which distorted the sound.  This was why I thought of a ""foreign"" tourist first, because of the weirdness of the sound. I heard about a half dozen calls and it was clear that whatever was making the sounds was coming in my general direction at a rapid pace.  By this time, I was sure it was not a human but a large animal.I was at the edge of a clearing and I waited at that spot expecting to see whatever was making the calls.  The first howl was maybe 250 meters away and the final one maybe 75-100 meters away.  Then it stopped and I never did see anything.  I did not hear it moving through the woods and did not notice any smells.  It is possible that whatever it was smelled me as the air was gently moving up slope towards the animal.  I think it probable that this was the reason whatever it was stopped moving towards me and vocalizing.I waited a minute or so after the final vocalization and then I went up slope in the general direction I had last heard it but did not see anything or any indication of a human or animal.  My curiosity was at a peak and so I made a real effort to find whatever it was and spent another hour circling the area looking for signs of a large animal passing through.  I have listened to the recordings on this site and I did not make a match between the sounds- though there were some similarities between what I heard and the calls from Washington State and the 'Ohio Howls'.  What I heard was not nearly as drawn out and evenly toned as the Ohio recording, but was similar.  A deep to mid-range 'howl' with a little variation in the tone somewhat similar to the Snohomish recording.  Each call lasted maybe 3-4 seconds and was seperated by various lengths of time from maybe 5 seconds to maybe 15 seconds.  Some of the recordings on this site, if I heard in the field, I might describe as having a 'monkey' quality to them- distinctly animal-like.  The Ohio recording does not really have that quality and neither did the sounds that I heard.  At the time I only thought of a human at first and then I was merely puzzled and could not classify what I had heard.I have thought about this incident since it occurred trying to put some explanation to it.  I do not think it was a human for a couple of reasons:  The sound, though it had a somewhat human-like quality, was not at all the type of sound a human would (or perhaps, could) make to communicate to another- say two or more people in the woods who are separated and walking along and vocally maintaining contact with one another. The volume of the sound would have required real effort for a human to achieve and I couldn't imagine a human being able to howl like that and walk around a mountain at that elevation at the same time- and it was traveling fast.  Nor did it have any element of humor about it if it was just some high spirited tourist having fun.  And there was only one caller, not two or more people hootin and hollering to each other.  The call was somewhat somber in tone and there was no hint of excitement or emotion about it.  Also, a human walking through those woods would have made a great deal of noise and I would have heard or seen a human when I went looking after the last vocalization.  I did not see any humans during that day though I went right to the base of the ski resort and could see the parking lot.At the time, the sounds did not spook me and I never got that unexplained adrenaline rush and surge of fear that I have gotten on more than one occasion in the wilderness or ocean.  I am quite familiar with the wildlife in this area and have heard and seen just about everything except a mountain lion. It certainly was not an elk, bobcat, coyote, dog, or cougar.  It might just possibly have been a bear-  I have had several close encounters with bears and have heard their vocalizations.  But bears do not, to my knowledge, vocalize in such a regular, loud way.  Because I heard 6 or 7 howls, I had time to really hear the sound and think about it.  To me it sounded most like an ape, though I only thought of this much later.What I heard was not much of an incident. I puzzled over it for a long time.  I am reporting it here because a sasquatch is the best possible answer that I can come up with, though I did not come to that conclusion until months after the incident.  So I did a web search on bigfoot and found this site and the recordings.  Another puzzling thing though- if it was a sasquatch, that area is quite popular with people and when I go there, I usually do see someone else.  That area could be easily avoided by an animal.  Despite the abundance of wildlife as a potential food source, why would a sasquatch travel through this area at midday in the summer , howling?  The whole incident is weird... "
61,OBSERVED: in sept of this year my son and myself and brother innlaw heard Loud whoops and screams in the Woodscanyon area near lake at midnight...i have heard same sounds and have made other  reports....in other Northern AZ....i own the BFRO vocalization Cds and these whoops and screams were the same....
62,OBSERVED: Im sure I know where an entire family of bigfoot live.  I have seen all diferent sizes of foot prints....so im thinking family unit?.....I haven't said anything to anyone besides my family...for the usual reasons..people think your nuts.....If your interetsed in me telling you my story in detail...just ask....I don't wanna waste my time and go through this in great detail if no ones interested.
63,"OBSERVED: a few years agao i took my wife and the kids camping and quad rideing....we camped in northern arizona about 30 miles east of flagstaff.....we camped in an area named Mormon mountian, very old forest never logged, old grown trees everywhere....that night while we were going to sleep in our tent i heard the yell first..thinking i might have dreamned it first i never got up or said anything  to my wife at first...then it yelled again makeing a whooping sound....it did this over and over as it went around our camp..i got up thinking this thing might be hostile...ill tel you ive been in az all my life and have hunted and fished here all my life...and ive never heard anything like this.UNTIL.....i heard thesame sound or yells on your website....."
64,"OBSERVED:   We were on our way back from Las Vegas NV going around 89A over the mountian road of Jacob Lake and the North rim of the Grand Canyon. My aunt thought it would be fun to play in the snow so we pulled over, we were in a type of gorge where the road cuts threw the mountians as were playing i thought i could hear someone yelling it was loud because i heard this sound over my cousins snow fight. i guess my aunt heard the same thing because she had a weird look on her face and as we were ready to leave the area we all heard the second howl this time it was loud and clear and deep. so we high tail it out of there my aunt did not want to know what made that noise. i compared this howl to the ohio howl on your website they are exaclly the same. i believe the howl i heard was not from the local wildlife. "
65,"OBSERVED: About 15 years ago my girlfriend at the time and I took a trip from our home in Albuquerque NM to Los Angeles to visit my mother. On our trip home we decided to stop by the Grand Canyon in Arizona because she had never seen it. We got there pretty late in the afternoon and we stayed to view the sunset over the canyon. We departed for Flagstaff soon after it had gotten dark. We headed down a less traveled stretch of road as a short cut. I do admit that I don't remember the highway number, but I will look it up. The road had next to no traffic on it and my friend and I took advantage of the time to talk. The highway was very curvy and we had just come out of a turn into a fairly long straight away when we noticed something walking down the right side of the road on the shoulder. Note the rest of this took place in amatter of a few short minutes although it seemed like an hour. What we saw was walking upright like a man, but was noticibly larger. As we got closer my girlfriend said ""is that a bear?"" It was at that moment that it became visible that our companion on the road was covered head to toe in brown to light-brown fur (hair). It was also at that moment that I realized what we were looking at. I had seen enough TV and heard enough hunting stories from my dad. I stopped the car. Our headlights now shown into the area that the bigfoot could see them and it stopped as well. We were about 50 yards apart at this point maybe closer. It then turned to face us. I'll never forget this moment it is burned into my memory. At first the animal turned it's head slightly to look back, but it's head seemed to be attached at the chest so it had to turn completly to face us. We didn't make a sound. We were in complete shock. Our friend was about seven feet tall and was covered head to toe in hair. The body was somewhat without definition as in I didn't make out features like hips or gender. The arms seemed to be abnormally long...maybe to just above the knee. The face was mostly hairless and looked...well without something else to compare it to kinda like a charactor from Planet of the Apes. Not exactly, but this creature deffinatly was from the ape family with just a touch of human looks. The eyes seemed to glow a bit green like a cat or dog in the headlights. It stood there for a matter of seconds and I could tell that it was thinking about it's next move. It ran it's tongue across the front of it's upper teeth in pondurance. It took one small step in our direction. My girlfriend went bizerk. She screamed in horror. It stopped it's forward movement, looked around, and headed into the woods near the road in a couple of strides. We never got another look at it. My girlfriend quickly got it together and wanted out of the area. I agreed. We took of and i made a wide turn around the area that the Bigfoot had once stood. I never got the feeling that it ment us any harm, but was very curious about what we were. You couldn't convince my girlfriend of that though. The event shocked here for life and she refused to ever talk about it again. To this day I'm sure she has blocked it out. I on the other hand will never forget it. It did take me years before I could tell my wife about my encounter. I am only posting my story for my own therapy and the hope that it will help someone else who has gone through something like this. "
66,"OBSERVED: I was hunting deer with a friend in area 6A north on 260 from Camp Verde then left on fs149 left on fs142 right on fs142D where we set up camp in 1989. On the third morning right at dusk we headed out to hunt some deer, I told my friend to hike up this mountain and follow it until he comes down on the other side, and I would hike up mid way and do the same in hope of spooking up some deer. We were to meet on the back side at the bottom the mountain and top side of a wash.After about 10 minutes into the hunt I saw a Fox to my right and ahead of me, he was about 70 yards away and heading in the same direction but in front of me . I kept watching him and ever so often he would stop and turn around the opposite of me and look back. I looked back over my right shoulder and about 120 yards away I saw this figure brownish black in color about 7 to 8 ft tall and very broad walking down in the wash. It was looking at me and continued walking deeper into the wash to where I couldn't see him any more. I only saw him for about 5 to 8 seconds. I wish until this day that I would have used the scope on my rifle up and got a real close up. I told my friend about this but nobody else until about 15 years later.The creature seemed to not want anything to do with me and I of it. I think that the fox was spooked from the creature and surely not me.  We hunted that same area for a few more days and several years after that and I never saw anything like it since.   "
67,"OBSERVED: I have hunted, hiked and camped the sierra anchas since the early 70s. I found a fresh track in the mud on the old homestead that was about one and a half times my shoesize and I wear a 11eee. Biggest and heaviest I ever saw of a human like print. It was fresh and I didnt want to be around there if it came back. I have camped in the old barn there and heard heavy footsteps about 2am in the morning, but didnt see anything in the morning cept for trampled grass. Also another time my neighbors heard growling in the brush while camping there and left. Not to far from there next to another homestead with another orchard like the previous one I heard all kinds of big rocks being thrown and tearing around in the brush, I retreated quickly. I found a deer that had all been torn up another time the legs been ripped of and something had been eating just parts of it which was puzzling to me as I have seen lion and coyote kills. A forest employee said somebody had been pushing down the hiking trail signs and now I am wondering. In 1981 I came home from a successful deer hunting trip and was about 10-15 miles north of globe heading there when I came around the corner and there was a dark figure standing there about 10 yards off the road on my side. The eye shine was bright red and frightened me. I slowed down to back up but decided no, I have a deer in the back that needs skinning and my pregnant wife was with me and I decided to skattle out of there. I had forgotton all about these incidents until I read the reports and it came back to me. I didnt think about bigfoots in Az. "
68,OBSERVED: I was on my way to work on a Monday morning. I had to leave a little early because of the snow and fog. I was leaving from near the Mt. Graham foothills headed towards Safford traveling about 15 mph. The fog was so heavy I could bearly see. I flipped my brights on to try and see better but it only made it worse.  when i turned them off I saw a hairy man like creature run across the road. It had to be at least 7ft. tall. I couldn't get a good look at it beacuse it vanished into the fog.  I know for certain it wasn't a human. 
69,"OBSERVED: Two buddies and I were camping on the top of Mt. Graham in an undeveloped campsite just past the turnoff for Riggs Flat Lake.  It was the middle of September, 1995.  The first night we were sitting around our campfire at about 10:00 pm when we all heard a loud unidentified blood curdling scream.  It was like nothing we had heard before - not human or any other animal like an elk or something that we had heard before.  The noise came from about 200-300 feet in the distance.  We heard the scream about two or three times over the course of 15 minutes.  We all commented about the noise like, ""what was that?""  But, we just kind of laughed it off.  Later that night, at about 2-3 am, we were sleeping in the tent when we heard ""something big""  creeping behind our tent.  It was definitely bipedal, because we could hear the pine needles crunching under the footsteps of whatever it was.  You could also tell it was big and had some weight to it.  We were so creeped out that I grabbed my 9 mm pistol and cocked it, and when we got the nerve we stuck our heads out of the tent and looked around.  Nothing was there.  The next morning I looked for footprints, but couldn't see any because of the pineneedles covering the ground.  The next night the same thing happened at about the same time - something big on two legs was walking outside of our tent.  When we looked out it was gone.   "
70,"OBSERVED: Camping in small pop-up trailer, my wife woke to the sounds of what she thought to be a heavy-set man laughing, she thought it was just another camper, but the sounds turned into some sort of crazy psycho laughing, then she got scared. In the morning she asked me if I heard the noise, I did not. I told her it was just a couple of critters fighting or something. Then a few months or so go by and I was watching a show about bigfoot, on the show they played a recording taken by a hunter, as they played it, my wife comes from the kitchen, white as a ghost and says ""That's what I heard on Mt. Graham"". So now I know it was not some small critter, and we just stored it away. A few months ago we got our first computer, going to your site I see another in the same area. Just wanted to run this by you to see if it can help."
71,"OBSERVED: I had never thought about reporting this until I read about the reports on Mt Graham. Lived in the Gila Valley as a child. Visited Mt Graham as a child with relatives from Michigan. I was 10 years old. I was sitting on a log with a slope behind me. Started feeling ""funny"", like something was watching me. Family called me back to the car, I glanced up behind me and there was something huge and dark partially behind a boulder right up the slope from me. I ran as fast as I could. It was hairy and tall. I hadn't heard anything before the sighting occurred. I told everyone and was told I was seeing things. I have never forgotten that visit to Mt. Graham. As an adult I am still freaked out up there. I know what I saw, it was not a bear! It was large, dark and hairy. I have looked into Bigfoot sightings before, but never connected it with Mt. Graham. I do now!"
72,"OBSERVED: Incident occurred on an old ranch approximately 50 years ago--i.e. around 1950--and was related to us by a native of Safford, AZ who said she and other people have heard the story all their lives, but as usual people joke about it--but the rancher who claimed to have had the sighting was very serious about it, and he said it was no joke and he would get angry when people would joke about it. The rancher was riding the range of his ranch on horseback checking on his cattle herd, and he saw a large, dark brown furry, upright creature walking on two legs that ""was not a bear"". He said he has seen bears his entire life up there on the range and insisted ""this was not a bear."" He said that when the creature was aware that the rancher had spotted him/her it turned and ran uphill up a steep tree-lined canyon."
73,"OBSERVED: I was archery deer hunting in September 1993, when I had a visual encounter with this creature.  Around 7:00 a.m., I was slowly stalking down a hiking trail in a heavily wooded area when I began to feel extremely uneasy and almost unnerved.  I had the intense feeling that I was being watched and/or followed.  There were no other people in the area other than my hunting companions and they were not in this general vicinity.  I kept moving along the trail literally one step at a time, all the while anxiously looking around for the source of my uneasiness.  After about 25 minutes, I was standing on the trail just looking behind me when I saw this creature walking rapidly down the same trail towards me.  I watched it walk closer and closer for about 6 - 8 seconds (it seemed like minutes) then when we were about 70 - 80 yards apart, it turned 90 degrees from the trail and disappeared over a ridge.  I followed it to the top of the ridge to try and get another look at it, but when I heard a sound that can only be described as a cross between a grunt and throat clearing, I decided I had enough and left the area.I returned to the area 6 weeks later to novicely investigate and came across what I can best determine to be a posssible bed.  The following year, while hunting the same area I came across an abandoned shelter that has no human signs as far as being built or utilized."
74,"OBSERVED: This happened in Gila Bend Arizona. My sister and her friend had went horseback riding down to the river bottom just north of the farm we lived on. I decided to ride out and meet them, so I took out one of our real gentle horses that never got excited and jumped on him bareback. My parents two dogs (rottweilers) were with me. When I got to the North end of the farm I had to turn west and ride parallel with the Gila River. There was a barbed wire fence between me and the river bottom. On the other side of the fence was overgrown with salt cedar trees. There was a cement ditch on the other side of the road which lead to a big sump full of farm run off water. When we got close to an opening in the fence, the two dogs started sniffing the air and acted a little excited and the horse was getting real antsy. I thought they could smell the other horses and I was close to them. All of a sudden the horse just stopped and started trying to rear up and when I looked around the dogs were gone. They had started running through the field back toward my parents' house. I heard something and looked at the trees and standing behind a tree looking straight at me was what I thought was a gorilla, then it stepped from behind the tree in full view. It was very tall because the fence didn't even reach the top of its leg, and it was covered from head to toe in long brown hair that was all matted and had salt cedar branches tangled in it. It just stood there looking at me  with a curious look on its face. I held the horse as long as I could hold him and just stared back trying to comprehend what I was seeing. I was riding bareback and knew I couldn't stay on much longer if I didn't get away. I let the horse take off running to get to the road leading back to the house. We had to run about a quarter of mile along the river and this horse was in a full out run, yet this thing seemed to be staying with us through the salt cedars. It was running on two legs along the fence just inside the trees with us. When I turned on the road toward the house I looked back and it was just standing there. I ran all the way home and told my dad and brother who laughed at me and told me I was just seeing things. They did however drive down to the river bottom looking for my sister and her friend. They didn't see or find anything as far as what I had seen. My sister and her friend said when they were coming out of the river their horses were acting scared but they didn't see anything. A few years later, my dad and my uncle had found a strange set of large bare foot tracks with what appeared to have claws in the mud near the same location. "
75,"OBSERVED: Hello my name is XXXXXXXX in the year of 2006 I was employed as a Forest Ranger patrolling the West End of the Fort Apache Indian Reservation I was sitting by the side of the road, right before the start of the airport.  I was waiting for woodcutters to return,so I can check their permits.  At this time it was about sundown but it was still light enough to see, I noticed a creature which resembled a man but was covered in black hair, but unlike the BigFoot reports this creature was about average height and I estimated the weight to be about 200 lbs.  I thought I was seeing things, the creature crossed from the northeast and headed west above the cibecue school. It crossed so fast by the time it crossed the road I was stunned and I drove toward the direction the creature crossed hoping to get a better look but it had already crossed into a gully.  I was afraid no one would believe me so I kept it to myself.  I don't know if what I saw was a juvenile BigFoot but whatever it was it seemed to disappear and the creature didn't seem to know I was there since it crossed about 100 yards in front of me, I was backed up off the road.  It was scary and I didn't want to get off my unit and investigate or look for tracks.  "
76,"OBSERVED: look, i will say first that i really like this campsite and dont want a bunch of random freaks going up there to look for bigfoot or whatever. you guys are professional about this, it seems, so if you want to go there, no worries. but i'd prefer if you didnt give the exact location out. long story short, i was camping up there over this past weekend. heard something really weird on friday night. really creepy too. ive heard all kinds of coyote calls and this was not coyotes, im certain. not a bird either. not an elk, deer, no kind of big cat. couldnt be wolf because there arent any wolves around here. didnt sound like a wolf anyway.  i dont dis-believe in bigfoot, not a cynic or anything. so if someone more informed than me listens to these recordings and tells me its a coyote then okay, great. but this was WEIRD. it was NOT a canine type sound. anyway, i was in the tent when i recorded the sounds, so there is static, but you can still hear pretty well. i will upload them to my computer tomorrow and send them to you guys if youre interested. the main reasons im reporting this are that 1. it was really weird, 2. i searched prescott bigfoot on the internet and saw the report from the other couple you have on your site. i listened to that ohio howl, it doesnt sound like that. but anyway. im no expert, so if you guys are interested let me know. ps. my writing is kinda all over because im super tired. but the first thing i did when i got home was to start researching this, thats how freaky the sounds were. "
77,"OBSERVED: i had just finished putting my children and wife to bed and had just stepped out the front door of my house to smoke a cigarette and put the cat out when i heard this very low but loud 'whooing' sound coming from the direction of the river bottoms. Hearing the sounds i distinctively remember from the sound recordings and this one was similar to the low, far away moan type sounds on the recording. To even hear the sound in real life made the hair on back of my neck stand up straight.  The sound only continued for about another minute and as soon as it silenced, all the dogs in the neighborhood, even coyotes in the distance, all at once began to bark and howl. I decided to stay inside that night and the next morning went to the tree line on top of the river to see or hear anything else, but nothing more than."
78,"OBSERVED: First off, I'd like to say that I happened across your website quite by accident -- a link off of msn.com, matter of fact.  I haven't given this much thought for years.I grew up in Arizona, and was always crawling around the woods, backpacking.  I was a Boy Scout, and we spent a lot of time getting into the back-and-beyond, where the average camper (and most day-hikers) simply didn't go.One of the big experiences is a 50-Miler Afoot/Afloat trip, where you go 50+ miles both hiking and floating, like a canoe trip with portages.  In Arizona, we didn't have much canoe water, so we made do.  We hiked West Clear Creek Canyon, an extremely remote and tougher'n hell area to get into and out of.  The ""trail"" was the bottom of the canyon and/or the creek itself.  To continue downstream, we inflated air mattresses and swam, pushing our backpacks on the matresses.  When we reached ground again, we'd deflate and press on.Needless to say, this meant that the area was virtually human-free.  We saw several bears at surprisingly close distance, bears that looked right at us as if to say ""what the heck are you?"" before scooting away.  The deer also weren't too skittish, which was cool.  Neither were the skunks, which wasn't.This hike travels from roughly Payson, near where we started, to Camp Verde, near where we got picked up.  We actually ended up at the end of Bull Pen Road, which used to be a fairly popular day camper location.In any event, suffice to say that the canyon itself didn't see many visitors.  Now for the time frame.  As best as I can recollect, this would have been in 1977, I would have been 15 at the time.  This has been in the back of my mind for that long -- but to *tell* anybody, you must first join the ranks of the loonie patrol.  That's how you'll be viewed, at any rate.All during the hike, we were paying attention to the critters, signs, spoor, tracks, etc.  Several of us were self-described Grizzly Adams, priding ourselves on our ability to identify animals by the evidence of their passing.About halfway through the hike, we came to what I recall was a mini-meadow.  It was a small patch of grass on a fairly stable slab of dirt, anchored upsteam and downstream by large rocks.  I thought at the time that this slab of soil, which was right next to the creek itself, should not have been so well-seeded with grass and low shrubs, but I suspect the rocks offered at least some protection from the annual floods.  At least enough to retain the soil, if not the plants thereon.At the edge of this soil, there was a small strip of mud beach at the water.  About two feet back from the water, and parellel to it, was a large footprint.  And I mean *large*.  And deep.By way of comparison, my foot was used.  I was about the biggest kid there, having a size 15 foot.  Placing my foot next to the print, my boot would be about 70% the size of the footprint.  We had no ruler or tape measure, but I guesstimated it would have been 18 or 20 inches long.  Big dude.I weighed about 220 pounds back then, so I got to be the depth tester, too.  I stepped in the mud, between the print and the water.  Even though where I stepped was wetter than where the print was, I left an impression of perhaps 1/8"" deep.  We guesstimated the print itself to be almost 1/2"" deep.  As I said, a big dude.There was no drying of the edges of the print, nor had the edges begun to curl down or slide back into the print.  The grass crushed inside the print had begun to bend back up, so we guesstimated that the print was older than 8 hours, but less than 24 hours old.We really wanted to take a cast, but (of course) we had no plaster, and couldn't think of a suitable substitute.  We didn't have the time to wait, in any event.Thankfully, the canyon went through a wide spot at that point, and we couldn't stop to mess with the track.  We had to make so many miles per day, so we had to press on after stalling there for about 30 minutes or so.  We were *very* very vigilant for the duration of that trip, I can assure you.  We had to have walked right past it, either before we saw the track or afterwards.  Creepy, thinking that something that big might be staring at you from the brush or the canyon wall.We heard nothing, and saw no other tracks, no hair, no scat, nothing we could attribute to ""the big critter"".  We tried, but even our overactive imaginations could not come up with another bit of evidence."
79,OBSERVED:  I was on the Thumb Butte Loop in Prescott next to the city park. While driving I spotted  a reddish- brown ape like creature. I stopped the car immediately and observed the creature. The hair on his arms was longer than the rest. It appeared to have little or no neck. It appeared to be very muscular and covered ground quickly. It was hard to judge the height of the creature because of the distance and shock but I knew it was tall. It walked in the tree line and there was a gap in the tree's about 75 meters long. I watched this creature walk through the opening. I remember his arms swinging and he only looked forward. I estimated (through military experience) that it was 100 meters from my position. I was sitting in the car with my head turned looking out the back and side window. I estimate that I saw him for at least 10 seconds although it seemed longer.  What I remember most is my mind was wrestling with the thought that what I was seeing was not supposed to exist yet I was viewing it. It was a most unsettling experience. What I tell you is the truth. I have never told anyone out of fear of ridicule and having my sanity questioned. I hope this information can help your organization.
80,"OBSERVED: I have to say, I was looking for just such a thing, being that I have an interest in the phenomenon (for lack of a better term). The ground was rather hard-packed with sand by the river-crossing areas. While passing a patch of mud from a spring I examined it and found the definite impressions of a five-toed human foot. I really couldn't believe it due to the odds of me actually wanting to see it (trying to be objective here). I checked for claw marks, such as a bear would leave, and found none.The footprint had pine needles covering most of it. Upon inspection I found the rest of the footprint was also there, down to the heel, and it measured approximately 13-15 inches in length. My brother and an Indian friend of ours, John, cleared away some of the needles to get a better look at it. (we were joking that John had some friends out there that wanted to make sure we had a fun time.) We took, I believe, two photos of this print with my hands pointing to the front and back of the track, but with the sun dirctly overhead, and not really a professional camera (although , I guess, Pentax is good enough for Steve ). I'm not quite sure how they'll make out. I was now determined to search the rest of the trail, and made sure that I went first so as to not let anyone else disturb other potential tracks. Right away in a sandy spot ahead I discovered another one, followed by more. One of the tracks was half the size of the first, and it almost appeared to be three-toed in places. We took shots of at least one more good one before heading up further to the summit. Being that there are open mines up there, I was a bit elated that we may perhaps be entering a ""hangout"" so to speak. nothing else was seen or smelt or felt (at least not at that time) apart from a set of indiscernible tracks going straight up a snow embankment on the other side of the canyon. Upon returning, after summitting and checking out mines, I lagged behind to study the ground again. I found better traces in the waning light than I did earlier, including some tracks that were better than the first set. They were very clearly humanoid and large, with at least two sets again (large and small). Unfortunately, my brother and my friend had used up all of their film (not to mention they were way down the trail yelling back at me to ""hurry up""). Upon staying back, and realizing I was alone, I finally got the jitters. Could've been my mind and the events leading up to that, but I felt I was being watched and I felt the need to bolt down the trail. I wouldn't have reported this at all apart from the fact that I figured this may be helpful for any geographical data-basing you may be doing (migration patterns, whatever.) Also, this may or may not be related, but on a trip to Mt Lassen about a week before, my girlfriend, brother and I were the only people on the hill there (hiking up another closed-for-winter road, the loop). along the way we kept hearing a vibrating ""whoop whoop whoop"" that would seem to come from all directions. We chalked it up to being a bird, but the low vibrations could be felt. Interestingly also, the sound ""followed"" us. For whatever that's worth, perhaps there have been similar reports from the Lassen area."
81,"OBSERVED: While walking cross-country, looking for possible home sites from the early 19th and late 18 hundreds, I was walking the base of a small ridge between two lakes Lower Blue and Twin Lake. On the ridge side it was mostly open forest on the Twin Lake side the brush got thicker. As I was walking I heard a loud two tone whistle [low to high pitch] that was not a bird or any animal I know. The sound came from ground level and behind me to my left. The whistle was loud and sounded in my opinion from a mammal. I turned and called out thinking a hunter [in a place he should not have been][no hunting zone] but no one answered, I whistled back but nothing called. Wondering what it was, I investigated the area 'till i could get no farther, the brush was too thick. I was standing within 10 feet from where the whistle came from, nothing in sight not in the trees on the ground not anywhere, no bird's where flying and no animals in sight either. It was a little spooky but at the time i was cross-country running almost 5 miles a day at 8000 feet as well as boxing training and being a good bow hunter nothing scared me at that time. I was 20 with a good outdoor understanding and other people were the only things that scared me. I remember after I got back to the cabin and asked my Dad what animal out there [if he knew] that whistled like us but much louder, he didnt know of any.  I did not think anything about bigfoot even though I was interested in the subject, I thought they were all up north in the Shasta and up area. I did not know that BF made whistling sounds until I went through the BFRO website. "
82,"OBSERVED: I am writing this for a friend who doesn't have internet access.  Last summer, he was driving towards Oroville.  He had just passed a place called Robinson Mill and came around a corner when right in front of him at about 100ft, something was crossing the road.  It was walking on two legs and was covered in a medium brown hair from head to toe.  One thing noticed was it's height; about 5 ft tall.  It's build was long and thin for it's height.  The hair hanging from its arms seemed to be long.  It was very fast as it ran.At first sighting, the being was walking across the road at leisurely pace but upon sensing my friend's approach, broke into what he described as a very hurried and incredibly fast pace.  He said that it literally leapt into the brush alongside the road at a dead run.  It never looked in the direction of my friend's approach.  It was right in the mid day's sun and was a medium dark brown.  It may have been a younger one or something because it seems in most sightings they are very tall.  Beginning of sighting was about a 100ft distance.  Distance was 35 to 40 ft at the last part of sighting.  He saw it leap into the Manzinita brush from only about 40 ft away!! "
83,"OBSERVED: I am filling out this report for a witness that I have already spoken with.  Witness had two ""events""; one a sound report and the other a print sighting.  The sound report happened in 1981 in the Carson-Iceberg Wilderness.  Starting at about 11:00 pm and ending at dawn, a whole series of howls began and continued every night for three nights.  The howls would start after two men with dogs started out into the forest after dark.  The howls were very deep, unlike anything witness has heard before.  The sounds would circle around a ridge and then end up where it started near their camp. They had a dobberman dog who was very afraid of the sound, and this is what alarmed the witness about the whole experience.  Witness has heard many bobcats and mountain lions, and this wasn't even similar. Sounded to him like the howls on the BFRO website.Footprints were seen in summer of 1984 near Beartrap Cabin in the Mt. Reba area of Calaveras County. "
84,"OBSERVED: As a new High School graduate in 1977, I planned a camping trip to an area near a boy scout camp (Wolfboro) I was familar with, with my new girl friend.  As an Eagle scout and an athelete (I was recruited to play footbal at Cal) I wanted to impress my friend who loved the outdoors.  The destination was around a dammed watershed called Spicers Resevoir.  There was a dirt (logging road) turn off from Hwy 4, between Bear Valley and Angles Camp.  We drove down this windy dirt road (some 7-15 miles), crossing over a little bridge that crossed a very shallow Stanislaus River (since it was very hot during this summer month), until we reached the end of the road at the dam.  We packed about a mile down the river (?Green waters River) that ran out the bottom of the dam. Only one side of the river had a hiking trail. The other side of the river was a very steep and rocky (e.g. boulders) bank.  This was in the middle of the week, and I knew from my scouting and other trips that very few people were seen in this area.  I was setting up my camp at a clearing next to the river and my girlfriend was fishing.  It was hot, as she had a tangled line while wading in the stream. She yelled up to me that she saw somebody crossing the river above us, some distance, from the other side of the river. Effectively to warn me not to be surprised if they walked past on the trail.  Nobody came down the trail and we forgot the incident. An uneventfull evening passed.  The next day we decided to break camp and go back to the Stanislaus (maybe there was better fishing). This obviously required us to pack back to the car and drive a few miles to the little bridge crossing the Stanislaus River. We parked next to the bridge and found what looked like a fishing trail.  We packed along the trail (if you could call it that) until it was too difficult to hike.  There was alot of little pines close together and there was bigger and bigger granite boulders in our way.  We found a clearing, some 20 yards from the river. I pitched the tent next to a dried creek bed.  The creek bed was a few feet wide and the tent was a dozen feet from it.  The rear of the tent was a few feet from a slope consisting of huge boulders and small pines.  We made a camp fire when evening fell.  It was a clear moonlite night except for the thunder we heard in the distance. I remembered that there could be these rouge thunder clouds. Anyway, later in the evening when we were about to ""turn in"" we heard strong screams coming from the upsteam direction. This was in the direction where we ran out of a hiking trail. The screams occured periodically for 1/2 to an hour.  I rationalized them to be a sick or injured ""range"" cow. During my scouting days I was told that cattle roamed the area and the snow level would effectively heard them down the river valley.  We went to bed and must of only been asleep for a couple of hours when the thunder clouds were close enough to wake us.  I wanted to put some things (e.g. shoes) in the tent so they wouldn't get soaked from the rain.  Once back in my sleeping bag I stayed awake listening, when I heard two foot steps behind us on the rocks of the dried creek bed. I listened more intensley and heard two more step, then a pause. I was really scared, especially since the movie Friday the 13th had been playing. I really thought it was a person stalking us.  I attempted to peer out the back (mesh) window of the tent.  Nothing was said between me and my friend and I didn't want to alarm her, even though I was scared stiff. What I did see was a large silhouette standing and then moving (the two steps at a time) past a tree in that dried creek bed. After, what seemed like a long time, the thing moved/walked deliberately past our tent twords the river. The front part of the tent faced the river and was zipped closed. But this thing, that I believe was Big Foot, started splashing and making that strong high pitched screaming noise at the river.  I then heard foot steps come directly twords our tent and stop right in front of the tent. My hand was on my buck knife.  Then I heard it run away.  I think, after a while, we might have said something like ""did you hear that?, lets get out of here"". Day break was only a short time off and we waited only for the first sign of light.  We hastily packed up camp and drove home. We talked about maybe checking with the ranger, but we didn't.  We eventually tied the ""fisherman"" crossing the river the day before, below the dam, to maybe not being a human but a Big Foot.  This so called ""fisherman"" crossing the river was ""dressed"" in very dark clothing, my girlfriend said, that seemed odd since it was so bloody hot.I haven't changed my story in 25 years.  You could even contact my old girl friend if you like."
85,"OBSERVED: I dont think this was a BIGFOOT sighting, and in fact never even considered it until stumbling across your site, and reading a few things that were similiar to what we heard. But I thought I would share, if only for the sake of adding to your information base.I had a friend visiting, and we were both awaked around 2:00-3:00AM, by a very un-natural howling sound.  It sounded as if a pack of wild dogs was running past the house.  We didnt hear any footsteps though, just a very odd sounding howling.  But it was like a mixture of howling and heavy wind combined.  Note, it wasnt windy that night at all.  We heard it for about 10 seconds, as it went past the house and kept going.  We could heard the sounds fade in the distance as it ran off.  We both sat there terrified, saying ""What the #$%$# was that??""  We didnt go outside to check it out, rationalizing that it had to be a pack of dogs, or coyotes or something.  Until reading your site, I hadnt really thought much more of it."
86,"OBSERVED: I am the Manager of the Visitor Center at Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park. During the winter of 2001-2002, my family and I were the camp hosts at the park, and lived in the park full time. One evening in mid-December 2001, I and my two children, ages 11 and 10, were in our travel trailer reading when we heard the a sound that made us cower. It was something between a human ""cat-call"" and a cow mooing, a kind of ""Ah-oooo"" that just echoed through the woods.I have served as a docent naturalist for the California State Park System. I have hiked the woods of California all of my life and I have never heard anything like this before. I have heard bear, mountain lion and elk, and this was nothing like those. What impressed us most was how loud it was. We have heard groups of humans in the campground hooping and hollaring and their noise level was not even close to this. We were inside of a travel trailer that had the windows closed up and the noise was clear and strong. We estimated that it had to have come from just across the Smith River from the campground.I decided to make this report after hearing what seemed to be the same kind of sound on a recent rerun of ""Sightings,"" a recording by Matt Moneymaker."
87,"OBSERVED: I was camping at Del Norte Campground outside of Crescent City California.  I woke up very early in the morning before anyone else.  It was about dawn. I was walking to the campground bathroom and I heard the loudest yelling I've ever heard that is hard to explain in words.  It echoed all thru the mountains.  It was a yell by something, but not a man, bear, or wildcat.  It took place 3 times. Needless to say I ran the rest of the way to the bathroom and my heart was pounding.  I don't know how else to explain it but with a yell or a hollar but so loud it would echoed off the trees and thru the mountains.  I didn't see anything, but I was too afaid to do any looking. A while after that I was watching a big foot documentary, where someone had recorded sounds they thought to be big foot.  This was the exact same hollar I heard.  It made the hair on my arms stand up.  I've never seen that video since and I would love to see and hear it again."
88,"OBSERVED: My family and I were heading up north to meet my grandparent for salmon fishing. My father was pulling our trailer and had to pull over for some reason. We all got out and we were told to stand away from the road. My sister looked down into a little valley where a river was running. She had said look at those. As we all looked down we notice there were large footprints in the sand along the river and leading to the east, uphill toward the forest edge. As we talked about what they might be we all heard some noise coming from the top of the ridge on the other side of the river. Thats when we saw just for a moument a large creature walking on two feet over the ridge and out off sight. We jumped back into the car and drove off. I may have only have been 8 but I remember it clearly."
89,OBSERVED: I wanted to comment on your report case #8595. My parents live in Sly Park. They are at the edge of the National forest. I have heard sounds late at night along with my brother who lives there. Last summer was the last time. But more importantly I have some photo's that I would like you to see. I have heard that Bigfoot often times will mark their territory or paths that they travel on. 
90,OBSERVED: Well me and my friend were hiking through the sierra nevadas until we heard a walking through the brush. I wasnt sure what it was but when i looked to my left i saw this big hairy creature it smelled as a garbage can. It had yellow eyes and was walking away. I tried to get a picture but it was moving in and out of trees. Later on in the night we heard a moving noise outside. my friend said it was a deer but i think it was the creature.
91,"OBSERVED:  First I would like to say that I'm very reluctant to tell this to anyone. I didn't report this because I thought the park service would think we were nuts, and I new of no other source that would take it seriously. I also didn't think the location of my sighting was one where other sightings had accrued until I used your sightings map. It was April 1993 when I went hiking in Desolation Wilderness with two of my friends for a bachelor weekend. We started out at the Horse Shoe Falls trailhead at Twin Bridges off of HW50 and hiked up to Lake Aloha. It was very hot going up the falls so we were very surprised to se all the snow at the top (that year we had some late snowstorms). We were disappointed because the lake still had a lot of ice on it, but not enough to walk on. We tried to walk around the lake but the deep snow and steep sides male it unappeasable.  We set up camp at the south end of the lake 200 yards west of the trail near a picnic bench. We were the only ones up there that fare in except some one that went up the southern slope of eastern mountain. There was no other tracks going around the lake and to my knowledge the back way in was to far to hike in those conditions. Trevor and I woke up early  (near sun up) to try to fish in one of the unfrozen spots near the bank, but it had frozen over that night. We were looking over the lake when we noticed some one on the other side of the lake walking around. We watched him because we didn't think there was a way around the lake and were curious how he got there. That's when it walked by the picnic table across the lake and we noticed that it was a lot larger than we were judging were the table came to on it's leg compared to were our picnic table came to on us (I'm 6ft and Trevor is 6.1ft). That's when we got out the binoculars and took a better look. We couldn't ses any detail of its face but its whole body looked dark brown to black. We were arguing about what we were looking at because we didn't want to believe what were looking at. At first we thought it was a bear but it walk to well on its back feet. We thought it was a hiker but it was not quite walking like a man (judging the long strides by the bench, we could not walk like that comfortley) and how easily it moved across the snow.  We went over to the tent to wake up Rob and show him but by the time we got back, he was gone. About 15min. later a lone hiker came down the southern slope of the eastern mountain into our camp and we asked him if he saw any thing on the other side of the lake and he said he watched some thing walking near the lake and then leave out through the north west side. We asked him if he saw any way we could get to that side and he said he could not see a way over. We told him about what we saw and he noticed the same thing (but not the same detail) we did.  The sighting was about 10 minutes or so, and has left us a lot to think about. I don't know if it was a Big Foot or not, but after watching the famous video of the Big Foot walking, I noticed that that's the strange way we saw the ""thing"" moving. "
92,"OBSERVED: I think the year was 83 or 84. That year there was a huge mudslide on the south (River) side of Highway 50. I remember because we had to turn around, go back up around Tahoe, and take Highway 80 back to the Bay Area. We were among the first to the slide area, and got out of our truck to look. It was early evening, and  I saw a huge, bi-pedal creature on the slide side of the river. It was on the Tahoe (east) side of the slide, as were we.  It was high on the hill, and appeared to also be regarding the slide. I saw it for about 15 seconds, when it ambled up the hill and out of sight. I have seen many bear, and this was no bear. A bear might rear up, but aside from circus bears, none will walk that way for any length. Even circus bears have an ungainly walk when trying to go on 2 legs. The motion of this creature was much smoother."
93,"OBSERVED: Hello my name is Tracie Q., and I am 35 yrs. old.  It has been over 25 years, back in the late seventy's, and my family and I can still remember, to this day, what we saw and heard during our motorcycle outings in the mountains.   At one time, we use to have a cabin off of Sly Park Road in the Pollock Pines area, and we would ride our dirt bikes at least 50 miles a day never coming across the same logging trail twice.Well, the first time, we were on the trail walking, instead of using the bikes, towards plum creek. My cousins and my sister kept hearing things around us, and I remember my parents saying it was nothing just enjoy the walk. We all would hear branches breaking, and things that a child, at that time, would think to be very scary. Well, this time, we came across a large tree which had fallen within the last few months. This is where myself and my family, still to this day, give Robin my oldest sister hell. Our parents were behind us and my Sister, being a smart ass goes up to look at this jelly like substance.  She puts her finger in it, and tasted it. Well, it was not jelly, but blood, and this is what makes this about bigfoot. Just on the other side of this log, my parents who had just ran up to see what we were all talking about, found this large, and I do mean a large foot print. We realized we were looking at something that was made by a large animal/human. My Uncle who is a big man, he put his boot next to it, and the size of it made his foot look like a kids footprint. If I remember right, they were saying it had to be over size 16.  This was a fresh footprint and the blood was still wet, and all I can remember, was that we all started back towards the cabin like there was no tomorrow.  Now we can't say that the blood was from bigfoot, but I know there was a large footprint. There was more than one time we came across something strange like that. Another time, I remember we were all on the bikes, and this time, we were either coming from or going towards the old ranger station that was located on the top of the mountain.  Where you were are able to climb the stairs to the top, which was over 3 or 4 stories high. Anyway, I want to say this was towards Grizzly Flats. I kept all of the old maps so that I could share the places we went with my kids one day. Well, there was a little snow left on the grounds that day, and we were taking a rest. My Mom has a thing for being the first one to step in fresh snow, so she goes off doing her thing, and all of a sudden she starts calling my Dad, not yelling, but you can hear it in her voice to get the hell over to her now.  When every body arrived at her location, there was this huge print, and it was human looking. The only thing about it was, that it only had one big toe. It was like it had all the others toes cut off, or just never grew them in the first place.  This print wasn't as big as the first one that I had seen. I think we saw them about a year or two apart, so it was not the same day or anything like that. There were other times when we would be riding, and you could hear something like voices, but not voices if that makes since.  My Uncle eventually sold the cabin and we stopped going up there.  Now that I live here in the Sacramento area , I have driven back to Jenkins Lake area several times and find myself sitting and wondering about everything that my family and I had seen up there in the mountains.  We never really told anyone about what happened, do to the fact that some people just plan don't believe.  Well I could tell them to stick it, because we are not crazy.  I know what we saw. We also would come across some old mines up there, and while at some of those places, you could feel like something was watching you.  I have tried to get back to Plum Creek, but a lot of the roads have been closed off.  What a shame there were so many beautiful places that are tucked deep into those mountains west of Lake Tahoe.  Well I feel kind of silly, but I just feel it was time to share these stories with others who believe.  Please feel free to contact me. I could tell you in person and my Mom and Sisters would also, but Dad is no longer with us.  He could have pointed the locations out on our old maps, just maybe my Mom can, but I can't say for sure.  Thank you for taking time to read this. "
94,"OBSERVED: It was late October 2006. My hunting partner and I were deer hunting near Heart Lake, which is located off the John Muir Trail behind Florence Lake.  We'd been back there for almost a week looking for the elusive Big Daddy Buck that we've hunted religiously for the last three years. We were high up on this ridge just before nightfall.  We were hiking back to our base camp and heard a loud bellowing howl that sent a shiver down our spines.  We looked at each other with confused looks on our faces, not knowing what that sound was.  We decided to hurry back to camp, but we heard another howl, but closer this time.  We saw Big Daddy Buck running down the opposite ridge side, and busting through brush, not caring if hunters spotted him.  Then again, we heard that bellowing howl, and saw on top of the ridge a dark silhouette that looked like a bear standing on its hind feet.  I brought my rifle scope to my eye to take aim on this so-called bear.  As I looked through the scope, I realized it was no bear.  I thought it could have been a really tall man in some kind of camouflage suit, but it looked like no man that I have ever seen.  It ran down the hill and disappeared into the brush, like it was chasing the deer.  So we decided to go and track down this creature.  Once we arrived at where it was standing, there was a footprint in the dirt that made my footprint look like a child's footprint.  It was four times the size of mine. We never saw the creature again and never heard that howl, but then again, I've never gone back since then."
95,"OBSERVED: I was sitting here listening to you on coast to coast and thought I'd tell you about an insident that happened in dec of 97.  the location was in the sierra navada mountains about ten miles above huntington lake which is about 60 miles above fresno in central CA.  Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said ""what the hell was that?"" and then said ""we better not tell anyone or they'll think were crazy!""  I can't swear to what it was, but I'll swear it wasn't a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all."
96,"OBSERVED: My story of Bigfoot was not visual but rather we heard a scream in the deep forest that we could not explain.  The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs, in the Sierra Nevada's in California, specifically, the John Muir Wilderness.  My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.    "
97,OBSERVED: this report is for my daughter who today thinks she saw two big creatures that looked like the  creature called bigfoot. She was pretty shook up about it.  She was so scared that she did not stop. She said the creatures were walking in a pond between Orick and Trinadad off of hwy. 101 this morning about 10:30. She said they were very close. She saw the big ones face. She said it looked like a monkey face. The other one was stooped over so she could not see him very good.
98,"OBSERVED: Well this was just supposed to be a fishing trip to see what the area had to offer.  I had been coming to this area for the past couple of months and started to learn it a little better.  So I decided to go exploring for some fishing holes.  All I had with me at the time was a fishing rod and a GPS receiver so I wouldnt get lost.  I parked the truck and started out on foot. I had talked to two local fishermen about what was in these rivers, and what to use. Im from the south and this area was like a new world.  So I made my way down to the river along the side of the bank.  At times the going got a little hard but I managed.  I tried several places but the water was moving too fast, so I thought that I would try and find a slack part of the river, where the flow was a little slower.  Now these woods are a lot different than the ones I was used to, so I was a little excited about this new area. I had been walking for maybe 45 minutes and covered maybe two miles when I saw something in the distance.  At first I thought that it was just a stump, seeing that I had left my glasses in the truck.  Now my vision isnt that bad, but I still need them for driving.  But, I started feeling a little uneasy due to an earlier encounter, plus it might have been a bear. But, being the idiot that I am, I had to get closer.  I got to within about 75 yards, because I was using the tree line as cover. That was as close as I wanted to get.  You could say that my heart was beating out of my chest it was like I had buck fever.  Well now that I was within good sight of the creature. It was easy to see what it was.  It finally stood up, and I didnt know up until that point how big it really was.  Now, I had a roommate who was 6'7 and this creature would have easily stood over him.  At the best guess I would have to say that it was 7'6 tall, and it had to weigh over 400lbs.  It finally turned to me and made me out in a second, but when it turned, it didnt run away instantly.  It just stood there.  I guess it was trying to see what I was. We must have looked at each other for 10 seconds or so, but it felt like 10 minutes. And in that time all I could see was that the creature had dark reddish brown hair, and the arms easily hung down to the creatures knees. But within an instant something spooked it. The creature turned and looked down river, and it just took off.  Now the ground that this thing covered was amazing.  I didnt move for a good bit, because I was in shock.  After the creature had left, I did the same, once I could get my feet working again. "
99,"OBSERVED: Well it has been a couple of years since it happened, but here goes.  I was stationed at Beale AFB, Ca., and I would always drive around looking for the next great fishing hole.  I had been driving for quite some time and had decided to pull into Humboldt Redwood State Park.  Being from Alabama, I figured seeing these big redwoods would be kind of cool.  So, I got off of Hwy 101 and took the Avenue of the Giants exit.  Driving down the road I was amazed at the size of the trees, so they kind of grabbed my attention. I started seeing a lot of places where I was thinking I could fish, so I started to slow down even more to find a place to park.  As I kept driving the river kind of started getting a little farther away, and I was about to turn around. When out of no where something walked across the road, and to say the least it shocked the you know what out of me.  The reason why it got me a little jumpy was because of the fact that I had to have come within a couple of feet of this thing.  Now I'm a pretty big guy 6' and about 220 Lbs., but what ever walked in front of my truck had to have been over 7 feet tall, due to the height of the truck (Chevy Z71). Now when it comes to the poundage of this thing I would have to say it was well over 350 lbs.  As far as physical features all I saw was the back and arm swing. The thing never turned around for me to get a better look at it.  But it had a large back and rather long arms.  As far as the neck goes it didnt really have one.  The animals traps made it look like it didnt have a neck.  Kind of like me.  But after I did find a place to turn around, I went back to look around, dumb I know, to say the least.  I only found a couple of tracks. They had to have been 14 to 15 inches long, plus the stride of this thing was a lot longer then mine. Just to make the stride this thing did, I had to make one heck of an effort.  Now all I can say is what ever I saw that day was nothing like anything I had ever seen in the woods, and I grew up in the outdoors."
100,"OBSERVED: During the last week of June, my girlfriend and I decided to take the dogs on a long walk. We were driving up the coast planning on a beach walk when I decided to go to a area on redwood creek where my friend had heard some unusual and scary whistles and screams. He is a very experienced hunter and outdoorsman with a degree in wildlife biology and he had never heard anything like it. Anyway, we were walking up the north bank, where the trails are, when I decided to cross to the south bank to check out some sandbars. I loaded up my girlfriend on my back and waded across. We then continued upstream a shortways when we came across three distinct footprints. They were approximately 14 1/2 inches long. I measured them with a stick that I saved. I compared them with my own barefoot track for depth and they were nearly twice as deep. I weigh about 280 lbs. I was surprised that they weren't wider, they were almost narrow for their length. I at first thought they were human because of this.  The best print had 5 very distinct toes and was flat, no arch at all, with toes straighter across than a normal human. It appeared that it had just leisurely walked into the creek. I scoured up and down for an exit point but the terrain wasn't suitable for tracks other than the odd sand bar. The strides were about 4 feet. It had come across a packed gravel bar leaving a few faint impressions. Nothing else observed."
101,"OBSERVED: On the day of the incident, a co-worker and myself where sent to close the Port-Orford-Cedar gates for the winter season.  Both of us are Forestry Techs and worked for Six Rivers Nat'l Forest (Seasonals).  As the day progressed and gates were closed we decided to take lunch at the Onion Lake area.  Once we got to the lake we had our lunch and rested in our own way.  I decided to walk around the lake to take my mind off things.  About half way round the lake I spotted something strange in the water, up the lake embankment, and into the forest.  I called to the co-worker.  We saw Bigfoot tracks that lead from the water into the forest.  I ran back to the truck and got a measuring tape and ran back to the tracks.  The tracks measured 14"" long 5 1/2"" wide.  The distance between the tracks were 3'.  We wrote down the track details in our IDEA pads (pocket note books) and then left the area to finish our work day.  We decide not to tell our supervisors because we thought our bosses would not believe us.        "
102,"OBSERVED: It was about 2:00 a.m., I was playing solitaire at the kitchen table when I heard a series of low, resonant yelling turning into high pitched screams. Immediately, I recognized the call as it has been described to me so many times by my dad and mom, and aunt and uncle. I'm 54 years old and I finally heard it! I'm thrilled! I'll never forget it. I've been going to this region since 1946. I'm thrilled!"
103,"OBSERVED: It was a typical winter afternoon in Humbolt County, it was raining intermitantly and the river was on the rise and becoming too turbid to fish.  But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the ""Where did it occur?"" section of this report.  I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a ""B"" then bellow ""Whoooooooop"", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That's not what this was.  Well, I didn't think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn't focus on it at first, I wasn't sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn't move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from the thigh up, it didn't move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn't see its eyes.  These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  I don't follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I'm not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there. "
104,"OBSERVED: My friend and I went target shooting one day in the hills east of Arcata Ca in the Spring of 94.  The next day we went out to the same location and noticed several trees had been broken and where blocking the road.  We examined the branchs and they were not cut, but physically broken.  They had to be at least 3-4 inches wide.  We didn't think anything of it, but we did get a wiff of a bad odor.  If I can find a map of the location, I can give you an exact location."
